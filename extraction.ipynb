First, we identified pivotal points of discourse where students might engage in an epistemic action toward alleviating a lack of knowledge. Then, we conducted in-depth analysis of discourse segments around the pivotal points. Results revealed that pivotal points identified by SNA were confirmed as alleviating lack of knowledge by further in-depth dialogical analysis.

The pair is working with the concept of scale and are in midst of copying their rooms from paper to touchscreen. During this process, the pair engages in a discussion regarding the size of one meter through language, gestures and manipulation of the material resource. The analysis shows two distinct ways of understanding the length of one meter, which primarily is visible through the children’s gesturing and bodily movement. In conclusion, the analysis shows that children dynamically produce body-material resources for communicative and illustrative purposes; moreover, they use body-material as a cognitive tool and as a way of shepherding the other.\\n', 'iso': 'en', 'none': ' International Society of the Learning Sciences, Inc.

We propose a computational model using ReaderBench that assesses collaboration from a dialogical perspective. Accordingly, collaboration emerges from the inter-twining of different points of view or, more specifically, from the inter-animation of voices pertaining to different speakers. Collaboration is determined from the intertwining or overlap of voices emitted by different participants throughout the ongoing conversation. This study presents a validation of this model consisting of a comparison between the output of our system and human evaluations of 10 chat conversations, selected from a corpus of more than 100 chats, in which Computer Science students debated on the advantages and disadvantages of CSCL technologies (e.g., chat, blog, wiki, forum, or Google Wave). The human evaluations of the degree of collaboration between the participants and the automated scores showed good overlap as measured by precision, recall, and F1 scores. Our overarching conclusion is that dialogism derived from the overlapping of voices can be perceived as a signature for collaboration.\\n', 'iso': 'en', 'none': ' International Society of the Learning Sciences, Inc.

Furthermore, we do not know what supports teachers themselves say that they need to teach about complex systems in their classrooms. In this study, we present a curriculum and instruction framework that outlines how teaching and learning about complex systems in high school science classroom contexts can be done.

The analysis focuses on how the topic of ‘construction’ is articulated in each data set.

The second factor contrasted state-of-the-art PFL learning activity (i.e., students studying Contrasting Cases) with an interactive tabletop featuring digitally-enhanced manipulatives. In agreement with prior work, we found that students who followed the PFL activity achieved significantly higher learning gains compared to their peers who followed a traditional “Tell & Practice” instruction (large effect size). Additionally, a similar effect was found in favor of the interactive tabletop compared to the Contrasting Cases (small to moderate effect size). Finally, we looked at four predictors to explain those results (students’ endurability, involvement, their curiosity, and the quality of their mental models). We found those variables to predict more than half of the variance (R2 = .58) of students’ learning gains.

Despite growing awareness in the CSCL community of the importance of design in teachers’ work, there has been very little empirical research on how such design is carried out, or how design for CSCL can be supported and improved through the provision of better design tools and design methods. The paper offers an analysis of the work of four pairs of designers in our Multi-Surface Design Studio. These four dyads were completing a design task we set them, while simultaneously learning how to make good use of the various personal and shared digital tools, display surfaces and other resources in the studio. From observational and interview data, we show how collaborative design for learning needs to be understood as a complex, multiply-situated activity, in which design problem-solving, tools and space usage depend on the fluent deployment of intuitive knowledge about mutual awareness, shared perception, information persistence and movement.\\n', 'iso': 'en', 'none': ' International Society of the Learning Sciences, Inc.

This allowed us to identify four types of assessment interventions. The findings indicated that only interventions in the immersion orientation seemed to help students learn how to learn. Such assessment practices enabled students to learn actively and to learn both disciplinary substance and metacognitive/regulative skills. However, relatively few studies clearly integrated assessment and learning. The main contributions of this study are the coding framework and the four patterns of assessment interventions.

Methodologically, we employ video-based interaction analysis, which facilitates a micro-level analysis of human interaction, to understand how learners deploy and assemble the material and social resources available in the outdoor learning context. We surface two noteworthy patterns about a) how learners in small groups leverage semiotic resources to negotiate, repair and converge at shared meaning in changing contextual configurations and b) how prior learning experiences affect the way learners employ semiotic resources.

Based on social cognitive theory, this study proposes two dynamic CSCL models of learning using understudied factors – system functionality, social ability, collective efficacy and social interaction – to examine mediation and causal relationships among these constructs and their influence on learning. The models are tested using data collected from a large US university. Specifically, while the predictive constructs are operationalized through the survey instruments, outcome measures are modeled using electronic trace data and actual evaluation information. Data is analyzed via the Partial Least Squares method. Results demonstrate close relatedness among the constructs and a different influencing mechanism on learning for each. The addition of social interaction as a factor to the learning model increases predictability of student learning as compared to models without this factor.

We report on the iterative design process that has shaped this web-based asynchronous learning environment and on its use as part of an active learning pedagogy. Using mixed methods we have tested DALITE’s effectiveness to support conceptual change, examined the content of its databases, observed its use in classrooms, and conducted interviews from users – students as well as instructors.

An augmented reality layer displays sound waves and shows how they are transformed at various stages of the process. Our previous work suggests that TUIs are particularly good at preparing students for future learning; that is, students learn more when they can explore a novel domain with a TUI before compared to after receiving a traditional (e.g. lecture or text based) instruction. In this study, we isolated the impact of structured guidance versus no guidance during a hands-on TUI activity on learning. In one condition, students rebuilt the hearing system by self-driven discovery; in another condition they rebuilt it by following the step-by-step instructions of a video-teacher. We found that the first group (“discover”) significantly outperformed the second group (“listen”) by ~27% on the final learning test.

Educational technology has mostly relied on providing only either task type, with a majority of learning environments focusing on structured tasks. We investigated in two quasi-experimental studies with 8-10 years old students from UK (N = 121) and 10-12 years old students from Germany (N = 151) whether a combination of both task types fosters robust knowledge more than structured tasks alone. Results confirmed this hypothesis and indicate that students learning with a combination of tasks gained more conceptual knowledge and equal procedural knowledge compared to students learning with structured tasks only.

Using this model, 270 paired participants, wrote a review of a document. Reports were assessed using a rubric associated with features of complex literacy behaviours. This paper focuses on the conceptual and empirical associations between those rubric-marks and textual features of the reports on a set of natural language processing (NLP) indicators. Findings indicate the potential of NLP indicators for providing feedback regarding the writing of such outputs, demonstrating clear relationships both across rubric facets and between rubric facets and specific NLP indicators.', 'iso': 'en', 'none': 'Singapore: International Society of the Learning Sciences', 'none1': 'Writing Analytics for Epistemic Features of Student Writing', 'none2': 'Book chapter', None: '\\n    '}, {'author': 'Sharma, Kshitij', 'author1': \"D'Angelo, Sarah\", 'author2': 'Gergle, Darren', 'author3': 'Dillenbourg, Pierre', 'accessioned': '2017-03-21T12:05:42Z', 'available': '2017-03-21T12:05:42Z', 'issued': '2016-07', 'citation': \"Sharma, K., D'Angelo, S., Gergle, D., & Dillenbourg, P.

We conclude by considering the implications of this expanded framework of teacher learning for future design and evaluation of professional development.', 'iso': 'en', 'none': 'Singapore: International Society of the Learning Sciences', 'none1': 'Expanding Outcomes: Exploring Varied Forms of Teacher Learning in an Online Professional Development Experience', 'none2': 'Book chapter', None: '\\n    '}, {'author': 'Olsen, Jennifer K.', 'author1': 'Rummel, Nikol', 'author2': 'Aleven, Vincent', 'accessioned': '2017-03-21T12:05:42Z', 'available': '2017-03-21T12:05:42Z', 'issued': '2016-07', 'citation': 'Olsen, J.

We aim to extend this work to elementary school students, by extending an ITS for fractions so it supports collaborative learning.

In our study, 189 elementary school students worked with a conceptual or a procedural fractions ITS, and either individually or collaboratively.

The study examines whether this perceptual compensation creates a comparable learning environment. Students who are blind worked with auditory models; sighted students used visual models. Conceptual understanding and systems reasoning were assessed with pre- and post-test questionnaires. Learning processes were captured by analyzing their workbook writings. The L2C environment not only supported blind students’ learning similarly, but also furthered their learning with one of the more challenging concepts, diffusion.

The goal of this paper is to illustrate how well-coordinated groups establish and sustain joint visual attention by unpacking their different strategies and behaviors. Our data was collected in a dual eye-tracking setup where dyads of students (N=54) had to interact with a Tangible User Interface (TUI). We selected two groups of students displaying high levels of joint visual attention and compared them using cross-recurrence graphs displaying moments of joint attention from the eye-tracking data, speech data, and by qualitatively analyzing videos generated for that purpose. We found that greater insights can be found by augmenting cross-recurrence graphs with spatial and verbal data, and that high levels of joint visual attention can hide a free-rider effect (Salomon & Globerson, 1989).

Using data from a 3-year implementation, we present results showing differences in attitudes towards computing by gender, while also finding similar gaps do not correlate with aptitude. Using pre/post measures, we then show female participants expressed improved confidence with computational thinking and interest in STEM careers.

Sharing is predicted by individual differences, such as gender, collectivist values, mastery goal orientations and academic self-efficacy.

Two researchers collaborated with a group of high school students with a shared goal of designing school technology practices that were meaningful to the students. Informed by theories of infrastructuring forms of participatory design (Le Dantec & DiSalvo, 2013), the collaboration explicitly sought to re-mediate the social relations of designing the school’s organizational practices with technology. This study analyzes the development and implementation of a student-designed school technology practice as a case study to examine how infrastructuring forms of participatory design mediated shifts in power relations and organizational practices at the school site. Results indicate that forms of participatory design which seeks to address social relations in the process and outcomes of design can contribute to shifts in student roles within the school and facilitate boundary crossing (Akkerman & Bakker, 2011) in which student goals were reflected in new organizational technology practices.', 'iso': 'en', 'none': 'Philadelphia, PA: International Society of the Learning Sciences.', 'none1': 'Participatory Design With Students for Technology Integration: Shifting Power and Organizational Practices in an Urban School', 'none2': 'Book chapter', None: 'Knowledge Building', 'None': '\\n    '}, {'author': 'Gebre, Engida', 'accessioned': '2017-06-19T10:52:18Z', 'available': '2017-06-19T10:52:18Z', 'issued': '2017-07', 'citation': 'Gebre, E.

In this study, we hypothesized that a curricular model based on scientific practices and agent-based simulations to teach biology through a complex systems lens would support students’ coherent understanding of biology.

This paper focuses on one important aspect of collaborative dialogue: expressions of uncertainty. In a study of undergraduate novice computer science students working in pairs, we observed that the students who produced the lowest quality solutions expressed uncertainty more often than those who produced middle-quality solutions. Perhaps surprisingly, pairs with the highest quality solutions also expressed more uncertainty than the middle performers. Examining the ways in which students expressed and then followed up on uncertainty revealed that higher-performing pairs utilized emerging learning opportunities when uncertainty was expressed, and remained focused on one task at a time. In contrast, the lower-performing pairs often did not resolve their uncertainty before moving on, attempting to work with multiple incomplete pieces of the solution simultaneously. These findings provide insight into how best to support collaborative learning during uncertainty.', 'iso': 'en', 'none': 'Philadelphia, PA: International Society of the Learning Sciences.', 'none1': 'Expressing and Addressing Uncertainty: A Study of Collaborative Problem-Solving Dialogues', 'none2': 'Book chapter', None: 'Innovative Design Approach', 'None': '\\n    '}, {'author': 'Csanadi, Andras', 'author1': 'Eagan, Brendan', 'author2': 'Shaffer, David', 'author3': 'Kollar, Ingo', 'author4': 'Fischer, Frank', 'accessioned': '2017-06-19T10:50:27Z', 'available': '2017-06-19T10:50:27Z', 'issued': '2017-07', 'citation': 'Csanadi, A., Eagan, B., Shaffer, D., Kollar, I., & Fischer, F.

We examined the types of portfolio entries at two youth-serving makerspaces (one out-of-school and one in-school), and observed the documentation of personal and shared projects in personal and shared portfolios. Our main findings are that, compared to portfolios that focused on personal work alone, portfolios that included shared projects and documentation presented richer showcases, showing technical and social engagement, assessment by people across a distributed community, and possibilities to narrate work to multiple audiences.

For learners in Makers, Making, and 3D printing online communities are vital as most knowledge sharing and problem-solving occurs online. In this study, we examine one online Maker community called SoliForum to better understand how an emphasis on producing physical objects shapes online interaction. Specifically, we investigate what kinds of messages elicit useful responses for those seeking help. We found that, compared to posts that contained only text, posts that contained media elements such as images and videos had a higher response rate and more resolved problems. Based on our analysis we attribute this to the more descriptive and explanatory power of multimedia elements and their ability to represent physical objects. The findings suggest that guidance for crafting messages using multimedia can lead to more equitable participation and learning in online Maker communities.

The present study investigates the role of instant sharing in the context of learning in a classroom setting. Two groups of students, from a suburban school in Mumbai, India, played an arithmetic game over a period of 7-8 months. The experimental group played on a platform that supported instant sharing, while the platform for the control group was standalone. All other aspects of both platforms were same. Analysis of process data of the two groups reveals that instant sharing increased engagement with the game.

Literature has revealed that learners had difficulties in collaborative argumentation on SSIs. The use of knowledge building pedagogies may be helpful for facilitating students’ collaborative argumentation. To examine the perspective above, this study attempted to integrate the KB pedagogies in collaborative argumentation regarding SSIs. In this study, learners’ collaborative learning behavior patterns in the context of online argumentation learning activities were explored. The participants were 48 university students from two classes and were randomly divided into experimental and control group (n=24 for both groups). The control group only received argumentation instruction, while the experimental group received explicit idea-centered collaborative argumentation (CA) instruction (focusing on both argumentation instruction and collaboration nature of argumentation). Then, the two groups of students were asked to participate in KB-based argumentation for four weeks, in which the control group was provided with original KB-based openers in the KF while the experimental group was provided with CA-based openers additionally. Data was mainly from students’ online activities log files in KF. By analyzing the students’ knowledge building and collaborative argumentation behavioral patterns, this study found that these two groups of students revealed different collaborative learning behavior patterns.
