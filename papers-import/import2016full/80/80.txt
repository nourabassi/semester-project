Thechallenge in schools is to foster a culture of sustained, creative work with ideas, as in out-ofschool Collaborative Innovation Networks (COINs) and cyberteams that self-organize to createknowledge. In this study, we examined the online knowledge work of three KnowledgeBuilding classes, where young students assumed collective responsibility for creating andimproving their community knowledge. We adopted the COIN concept of rotating leadershipto visualize collective responsibility for knowledge advancement. Using a mixed methodsapproach, we conducted social and temporal network analyses, then content analyses of studentnotes to further assess cases of student leadership. Overall, we found relatively decentralizedstudent networks, with most students leading the group at different points in time; when leading,students were connecting unique ideas to the larger class discussion. We discuss our findingswithin the context of designing embedded, transformative assessment for knowledge buildingcommunities.Keywords: Knowledge Building; Collaborative Innovation Network; collective responsibility; rotatingleadership; self-organization; knowledge creation; innovationIntroductionTo prepare students for a world of constant change (Takeuchi & Nonaka, 1986) within innovation-driven societies(OECD, 2010), many 21st century education movements (e.g., Johnson, 2009; Ananiadou & Claro, 2009) aim toequip students with skills in creativity, critical thinking, collaboration, and communication. Apart from changingcurricular goals, however, most classroom activities continue to be teacher-directed, with students being assessedindividually against traditional benchmarks (Griffin, McGraw, & Care, 2012). Such fixed structures and processesprevent innovation, adaptability, and new competencies from emerging in schools (Sawyer, 2015; Scardamaliaet. al., 2012). One way to address educational challenges of the 21st century is by exploring innovativeorganizational configurations for knowledge creation in schools (Bereiter, 2002; Sawyer, 2006; Philip, 2011).Knowledge Building, which is synonymous with knowledge creation (Scardamalia & Bereiter, 2014;Bereiter & Scardamalia, 2014), represents a longstanding effort at building cultural capacity for innovation. Itaims to transform education into a knowledge-creating enterprise by creating a culture of innovation in classroomsand engaging students directly in sustained, creative work with ideas, so that students are engaged continuouslyin creating knowledge of value to the community (Scardamalia & Bereiter, 2003). From a young age, students areempowered to take ownership of their learning through participation in high-level decision processes, so that allshare collective responsibility for advancing the community goals (Scardamalia, 2002).In contrast to many activity-centered and procedure-based constructivist pedagogies, KnowledgeBuilding uses an idea-centered, principle-based design approach (see Scardamalia, 2002 for overview of 12principles). For example, the principles of idea diversity, improvable ideas, and rise above prioritize students’ideas at the center of class interactions and highlight the iterative nature of idea generation, refinement, andinvention in knowledge creation processes that enhance the breadth and depth of group understanding andachievement. Principles of epistemic agency, democratizing knowledge, and community knowledge, collectiveresponsibility create contexts for empowering students to take charge of knowledge creation processes at thehighest level, including defining problems, setting goals, contributing to and monitoring goal progress,synthesizing advances at new and unexpected levels, and more generally, giving priority to knowledge creatinginteractions as cultural practices (Bereiter & Scardamalia, 2014). In a successful Knowledge Building classroom,the teacher and students embody all twelve principles as they work collaboratively toward creating communityknowledge. The teacher supports student agency and autonomy by facilitating improvisation in their own practicethrough opportunistic collaborative engagement (Zhang et. al., 2009), wherein the teacher encourages students toself-organize into small groups based on emergent goals of the community. Similarly, Collaborative InnovationNetworks (COINs; Gloor, 2006), which create knowledge and drive innovations around the world, function basedICLS 2016 Proceedings615© ISLSon principles of autonomy and self-organization. Whereas highly productive teams have stable leaders, COINsoperate in a decentralized fashion with various emergent leaders rotating leadership over the course of a project(Gloor et. al., 2003; Kidane & Gloor, 2007). Members share collective responsibility for their knowledge workthrough a high degree of connectivity, interactivity, and sharing (Gloor, 2006). The idea-centered, principle-baseddesign approach to Knowledge Building pedagogy emphasizes the role of self-organization in knowledge creationand innovation (Hong & Sullivan, 2009; Scardamalia & Bereiter, 2014), which is consistent with how COINsoperate.Because the Knowledge Building process is emergent and non-linear, assessment designs mustcomplement the 12 Knowledge Building principles in a way that supports and sustains collective progress, asindicated by the principle of concurrent, embedded, and transformative assessment. Previous work aimed atdeveloping principle-based indicators of collective responsibility for community knowledge advancement useddescriptive statistics (e.g., van Aalst et. al., 2012) to assess online reading and writing behaviours and socialnetwork analyses (e.g., Philip, 2010) to assess collaboration patterns within the community. Additionally,semantic measures (e.g., Hong et. al., 2015) and lexical measures (e.g., Sun, Zhang, & Scardamalia, 2010) weredeveloped to assess the diffusion of ideas within the community and the growth of community knowledge overtime. While quantitative measures are useful for capturing patterns of social interactions and communityconnectedness, qualitative analyses are useful to assess the quality and coherence of ideas, concepts, and theoriesshared between students. Thus, in designing Knowledge Building assessments, it is important to integrate socialnetwork analyses with content analyses in order to understand the complex process of collaborative meaningmaking (van Aalst, 2012). We further add that the ideal assessment would integrate social, semantic, and temporalaspects of Knowledge Building.The current study is exploratory in nature, with the goal of developing a new method to assess collectiveresponsibility for knowledge advancement in three Knowledge Building classes. We hypothesized that if youngstudents are really taking on collective responsibility and self-organizing to create community knowledge, wewould find rotating leadership as an emergent phenomenon of these classes, as in COINs. In adopting the stancethat a Knowledge Building class is a complex, self-organizing system with multiple components interacting atmultiple levels, we created two sets of research questions which corresponded to two levels of analyses:1. At the group level, what does rotating leadership look like in the Knowledge Building class? How manystudents emerge as leaders over the course of the inquiry?2. At the individual level, what is happening when a student is leading? How are they contributing to thegroup discourse?MethodsIn recognition of the complex and dynamic nature of the Knowledge Building process, we adopted acomplementary mixed methods design (Greene, Caracelli, & Graham, 1989) in order to harness the strengths ofquantitative and qualitative analyses and develop a more holistic understanding of the phenomenon under study:collective responsibility for knowledge advancement. We used quantitative methods (i.e., social and temporalnetwork analyses of online interactions) to address the first sets of questions, and we used qualitative methods(i.e., content analyses of online discourse) to address the second sets of question.Data sourcesOur samples consisted of Knowledge Building classes at the Dr. Eric Jackman Institute of Child Studyparticipating in Beyond Best Practice and Ways of Contributing research projects (2002-2012) located in Toronto,Canada. In order to test our hypothesis, we selected successful Knowledge Building classes and conductedsecondary analysis to validate a new method of assessment. We selected classes in which 1) students engaged insustained inquiry for a minimum of three months, 2) students documented their knowledge advances throughextensive writing online, and 3) Knowledge Forum support was integrated into daily classroom practices.Knowledge Forum (Scardamalia, 2004) is an online community space optimized to support knowledge creationprocesses. Students contribute ideas as notes in conceptual spaces called views; connect ideas with “build-on”notes; and generate explanations/syntheses with “rise-above” notes. Student work in Knowledge Forum involvescontinuous reading, writing, and revising of notes to advance the community knowledge. In summary, Case 1:Grade 4 light consisted of 22 students engaged in inquiry about light for three months. Students wrote 380 notesacross 8 views: Light, How Light Travels, Colors of Light, Light and Materials, Natural and Artificial Light,Shadows, Images in our Eyes and in Films, and All We See Is Light. Case 2: Grade 1 water consisted of 21students engaged in inquiry about water for three months. Students wrote 391 notes across 3 views: All aboutClouds, Where did water come from?, and Evaporation. Case 3: Grade 4 rocks consisted of 23 students engagedICLS 2016 Proceedings616© ISLSin inquiry about rocks for four months. Students wrote 269 notes across 3 views: Rocks and Minerals,Volcano/Lava, and The Big Bang and the Universe. See Table 1 for summary of three cases.Data analysesThe first stage of analysis involved quantitative methods. Student notes in Knowledge Forum were spellcheckedand exported into KBDeX (Knowledge Building Discourse Explorer; Oshima, Oshima, & Matsuzawa, 2012) inorder to facilitate social and temporal network analyses based on a list of content-related words extracted fromthe Ontario Curriculum of Science and Technology, which served as benchmark concepts in the communityknowledge. KBDeX produces network visualizations of the learners network, notes network, and words networkbased on the co-occurrence of key words in each network, with the thickness of edges representing the strengthof connections. For example, the learners network shows idea sharing across learners, the notes network showsidea overlap across notes, and the word network shows how ideas are connected in the community knowledge asthe group discussion unfolds. KBDeX also produces temporal visualizations of network metrics, such asbetweenness centrality, which indicates the extent to which a member influences other members of the group(Gloor et. al., 2003). Whereas a betweenness centrality value of 1 means that a member is highly influential, avalue of 0 means that a member is equally influential as other members. In using KBDeX, we were able to explorethe three networks seamlessly in order to examine stages of the inquiry when a specific learner had highbetweenness centrality, as indicated by the emergent peaks in the temporal visualization (see Figure 1). Forexample, when we selected a specific learner in the learners network, their corresponding notes were highlightedin red in the discourse network, and their corresponding keywords were highlighted in red in the word network(see Figures 2a, 2b, 2c respectively). The second stage of analysis involved qualitative methods. After identifyingleaders with a betweenness centrality value of 0.20 or higher, we used KBDeX to explore the three networks inorder to understand the discursive context that supported their emergence as the leader: 1) which students sharedthe same ideas as this specific leader, 2) which notes contained the same ideas as this specific leader’s notes, and3) which ideas this specific leader connected together. More specifically, the note network allowed us to conductcontent analyses on notes immediately connected to that specific leader; we interpreted notes isolated from thisnetwork as student efforts directed toward diverse and unique ideas in the community knowledge. By tracing andcomparing changes in the network shapes across different times, we were able to identify pivotal points in thegroup discourse that led to greater connectedness of ideas (i.e., explanatory coherence), which we interpreted asknowledge advancement. Below, we present one leader (i.e., influential student) from each Knowledge Buildingcase.FindingsTable 1 shows descriptive measures to assess Knowledge Building in all three cases. Network measures forreading and writing behaviours, such as average weighted degree (AWD), transitivity, average path length (APL),and average betweenness centrality (ABC), indicate that students were working productively in KnowledgeForum for each case. Overall, reading networks are denser than build-on networks, suggesting that students readmore of their peers’ notes than they did build on them. In the section below we present our findings for eachKnowledge Building case from general to specific: rotating leadership at the group level, followed by a detailedaccount of what happened when a particular student was leading. For each case, we present our results in thefollowing order: temporal analyses, network analyses, content analyses.Table 1.

Network visualizations at turn 175: a) student network, b) note network, and c) word network.Below is an excerpt of the discussion where student 11 played an important role in connecting ideas from theirpeers’ notes in the Natural and Artificial Light view. The problem of understanding, as indicated by student 24,is light as an energy source. Student 24 raised a question about how solar energy works, while student 8 sharedtheir theory about solar panels, and student 14 described their experiment about light mills. Student 11 added theirtheory about how the source of light would relate to its strength of energy. Student 11 hypothesized that sunlightwould be a stronger source than a flashlight and added that a magnify glass could be used to adjust the strengthof energy. Student 11’s note connects student 24, 8, and 14’s notes to the larger discussion about lenses andmagnifying glasses, where student 16 explains how different types of lenses and glasses adjust the strength oflight.Student 24:solar power is everywhere or it should be everywhere because it’s just asgood as regular energy i don’t know how it works but it is just as good.Student 8:[My theory]: is that the light from the power plant is sunlight that comesfrom solar panels.Student 14:[We] did an experiment that was a light mill. we went outside to see if themill would spin by using sunlight. we don’t know which way the millturned?Student 11:[My theory]: is that the sunlight can produce stronger solar energy. underthe sun. some people do it by using a magnify glass. maybe the glassfocuses the light on the ant which burns it. i think if you tried to burn an antunder a flashlight the source of the light would not be strong enough.ICLS 2016 Proceedings618© ISLSStudent 16:lens have two sides one is called convex and one is called concave. Whenyou put light on a magnify glass it will make the light get smaller and hotterand it will close in. it also depends on the different types of glasses on thedifferent types of shapes.Case 2: Grade 1 waterBetweenness centrality valueFigure 3 shows temporal analysis of betweenness centrality for Case 2.

The problem of understanding, as indicated by student 1162041,is whether or not there is water in space. Student 1162041 raised a question about where water goes in space,while student 185293 wondered about water from space mixing with salt on earth and student 1044599 sharedtheir theory about water coming from space. Student 195251 added their theory about how the atmosphere stopsclouds (and by extension, water) from entering space. Student 195251 hypothesized that since there is no air inspace, there are no clouds (and by extension, water) in space. Student 195251’s note connects student 1162041,1852393, and 1044599’s notes to the larger discussion about clouds, water, and evaporation, where student195313 observed that you cannot see water in a cloud.Student 1162041: [I wonder]: if water is in space where does it goStudent 185293: [I wonder]: if water came from space and mix with salt on the ground?Student 1044599: [My theory]: it could have came from spaceStudent 195251: [My theory]: there is no air in space and cloud are air and i think that theatmosphere will stop it so the air can’t goICLS 2016 Proceedings619© ISLSStudent 195313: inside a cloud the only color you see is white and you can’t see water in itCase 3: Grade 4 rocksBetweenness centrality valueFigure 5 shows temporal analysis of betweenness centrality for Case 3.

The problem of understanding, as indicated by students 277 and 434is the relation between atoms and matter. Student 277 raised a question about the composition of atoms whilestudent 398 referred to an authoritative source about atoms and earth, and student 434 provided information thatatoms are made of electrons, nucleus, and other matter. Student 379 added their theory about how atoms andmatter relate to the big bang and life on earth. Student 379 hypothesized that atoms collided to form planets, whichallowed for life to evolve on planet earth.

Our findings demonstrate that rotating leadership, as indicated byoscillating patterns of betweenness centrality, is an emergent phenomenon in Knowledge Building classes, wherestudents work collaboratively to create community knowledge while receiving appropriate pedagogical andtechnological supports. In Case 1: grade 4 light, 20 of 22 students were leaders. In Case 2: grade 1 water, 12 of21 students were leaders. In Case 3: grade 4 rocks, 11 of 23 students were leaders. When students were leading,they were generating new theories by connecting their peers’ unique ideas with the larger class discussion, thusdemonstrating principles of epistemic agency, idea diversity, improvable ideas, rise above, and communityknowledge, collective responsibility. It is interesting to note that in all three cases, in addition to having leaderswho rotate frequently, multiple leaders appeared to emerge simultaneously. Further analyses are needed tounderstand leadership dynamics with multiple, “shared” leaders, seemingly engaged in symmetric, mutuallysupportive advances. COIN theory (Gloor, 2006) suggests that having a strong core with several overlappingleaders is conducive to group creativity and productivity, thus the “sharing” of rotating leadership may also bebeneficial for the Knowledge Building community as a whole.Future work on Knowledge Building assessments should aim to verify our findings across variouslearning contexts (e.g., learner’s age, subject matter, school culture). KBDeX represents a powerful analytic toolfor providing formative feedback during Knowledge Building (e.g., Matsuzawa et. al., 2012, Resendes et. al.,2015). We believe that rotating leadership has the potential to serve as a descriptive measure for teachers andstudents to assess and monitor group progress as their creative work proceeds, and ultimately help sustaininnovative interactions in the 21st century classroom.ReferencesAnaniadou, K. and Claro, M.
