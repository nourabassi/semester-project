Prior Knowledge and Mathematics Different Order Thinking Skillsin Multimedia LearningThomas K.F. Chiu, The University of Hong Kong, tchiu@hku.hkAbstract: This experimental study investigated prior knowledge and instructional visual aid ondifferent mathematical order thinking skills of remembering, understanding and analyzing inmultimedia learning. One hundred and twenty-three secondary school students was randomlyassigned to a condition, in a 2 (prior knowledge: weaker vs stronger) x 2 (aid: with vs without)between subjects factorial design. In the experiment, the aid was evolved from variation theoryand multiple representations and the materials were designed using multimedia learningprinciples. The results showed that the stronger group learned better on remembering, only theweaker group benefited from the aid on understanding, and the aid was more beneficial onanalyzing. We suggest that multimedia presentation designs should take into account priorknowledge and order thinking. Limitations and future research are discussed.Keywords: prior knowledge, multimedia learning, mathematics, order thinking skill, cognitiveprocessingIntroductionMultimedia presentations should display images and words simultaneously for learning (Mayer, 2009). The useof the presentations are considered effective in learning for mathematics, as it results in better remembering(retention) and understanding (transfer) skills (Chiu & Churchill, 2015a, 2015b; Mayer, 2009). Learner priorknowledge can influence the effectiveness of learning with multimedia presentations (Kalyuga, 2014; Mayer,2009; Schnotz & Lowe, 2003). Many experimental studies showed that learners of different prior knowledge levelresponded differently to a multimedia design (Kalyuga, 2014; Leslie, Low, Jin, & Sweller, 2012, Liu, Lin, & Paas,2014; Potelle & Rouet, 2003; Spanjers, Wouters, Van Gog, & Van Merrienboer, 2011). In their experiments, thetests used assessed remembering and understanding, but not higher order thinking skills. Their additional designs,treatments, were not customized for a specific domain (e.g. Spanjers et al. 2011; Leslie et al., 2012). Higher orderthinking skills that require dynamic and relational internal (mental) representations would receive different effectsfrom the additional designs. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effects of prior knowledge and visual aidon three different order thinking skills of remembering, understanding and analyzing for algebra. Since manystudies were conducted for remember and understanding, this study focuses on the higher thinking skill ofanalyzing. It is expected that the aid would differently affect the development of the three thinking skills. The aidwas designed specifically for algebraic learning.Prior knowledge and multimedia designThe cognitive theory of multimedia learning suggests that learners select relevant multimedia messages from thepresentations (extraneous processing), organize them into a mental structure (essential), and finally integrate itwith relevant prior knowledge (generative) retrieved from long-term memory (Mayer, 2009). Therefore, priorknowledge level and recalling process directly influence the effectiveness of the integration process – acquiringnew knowledge – in multimedia learning (Chiu, 2015; Kalyuga, 2014; Mayer, 2009).Many experimental studies support prior knowledge has impact on remembering and understanding inmultimedia learning (Chiu, 2015; Kalyuga, 2007, 2014; Kalyuga et al., 2000; Leslie et al., 2012; Rey & Fischer,2013; Spanjers et al., 2011). The experimental materials included additional designs, such as presenting aidsaudibly and/or visually, and controlling the pace of learning (see segmenting principle). For example, the designthat showed steps to learn with images presented on screen worked best for weaker learners, but not for strongerlearners (Kalyuga et al., 2000); visual representations helped younger children (less prior knowledge) learnscience, but not older children (Leslie et al., 2012); segmented animations were more effective than continuousanimations for less knowledgeable learners (Spanjers et al., 2011); and adding expository examples andillustrations was more beneficial for weaker undergraduate students rather than stronger students when developingthe statistical skill (Rey & Fischer, 2013). The studies suggested that the designs – treatments – helped weakerlearners understand the images and words presented. The designs provided information or environments to guideweaker learners to connect images and words presented thereby easing the cognitive processing for searching orrecalling. In contrast, stronger learners may found the information is duplicated or the environments arediscouraging. The designs became a burden, which required additional cognitive processing (Kalyuga, 2014).ICLS 2016 Proceedings154© ISLSThis processing was unnecessary and resulted in less cognitive capacity for other kinds of processing, which ismore important for stronger learners (Kalyuga, 2014). Moreover, most of the studies indicated incorporatingadditional design in multimedia representations was effective for both learners on remembering, but was effectivefor weaker learners only on understanding when learned from the presentations (Leslie et al., 2012; Rey & Fischer,2013; Spanjers et al., 2011).Instructional design for presentation – algebraAn important factor in experimental studies is the additional design. Instructionally providing appropriate andrelevant learning messages for a specific-domain is beneficial for learners (Brophy, 2001; Marton et al., 2004;NCTM, 2000). In algebra teaching, numerous studies on presenting various forms of learning information forstudents have been conducted. Rittle-Johnson and Star (2007, 2009) endorse comparing and contrasting solutionmethods – students learn better by comparing an equation and its different solution methods, or by comparingdifferent forms of an equation and their solution method. By applying variation to algebra teaching, studentsunderstand concepts better by seeing and experiencing different algebraic forms and solving methodssimultaneously (Marton et al., 2004; Mok, 2009; Mok et al., 2002). Other than teaching strategies evolved fromthe variation, NCTM (2000) suggests that mathematics concepts should be presented in four forms that arenumerical, graphical, algebraic and descriptive simultaneously to ensure effective algebra learning.Mathematics orders of thinking skills and cognitive processingThe revised Bloom’s Taxonomy categorized skills into six cognitive process dimensions (Anderson et al., 2001).The taxonomy suggests six orders of thinking skills. They are remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing,evaluating and creating. Remembering requires learners to retrieve, recognize and recall relevant knowledge fromlong-term memory; understanding requires them to construct their knowledge by way of classifying, summarizingand comparing; applying requires learners to implement procedure; analyzing requires learners to determine howparts relate to each another and to an overall idea; evaluating requires students to make judgments and explaintheir decisions; and creating requires students to reorganize what they have understood into a new pattern.In mathematics, a higher order thinking skill requires more complete understanding (Berger & Torner,2002; Derry, 1990; Rabinowitz, 1988) – a large number of knowledge and concepts needed for its development(Derry, 1990; Sweller & Cooper, 1985). Instructional methods for the higher order thinking skill will be moreeffective if they helped learners acquire prerequisite knowledge beforehand (Derry, 1990; Sweller & Cooper,1985), for example, acquiring procedures of reassigning variables in an algebraic equation before solvingconventional problems (Sweller & Cooper, 1985). Learning methods of lower order thinking skills can contributeto development of higher order thinking skill (Derry, 1990; Silver & Marshall, 1990). Developing a higher orderthinking skill can involve different types of thinking/cognitive processes of its own and/or other lower orderthinking skills (Derry, 1990; Silver & Marshall, 1990). In other words, more different thinking processes are likelyto be involved when developing higher order thinking skills, which may lead to heavier learner essential andgenerative processing.According to cognitive theory of multimedia learning, essential processing comprises selectingmultimedia messages from a presentation (Mayer, 2009). An instructional design better instructs learners how tolearn with images and words, which requires less time in selecting process, suggesting a more-structured designhas less essential processing than a less-structured design. In other words, in less-structured environment, learnerswill have heavier essential processing and need more help. Less-structured environments are more effective todevelop higher order thinking because the environments do not impede conceptually oriented interactions (Cohen,1994). An instructional design, such as visual aid, that complicates development of lower order thinking skillsmay become more helpful for stronger learners when developing higher order thinking skills in less-structuredenvironments.MethodsThe present studyThe present study aims to investigate prior knowledge and visual aid on remembering, understanding andanalyzing for secondary level algebra in multimedia learning. The materials used in the experiment were designedusing Mayer’s multimedia learning principles; the aid was designed for algebraic learning. We hypothesized that(1) the stronger students would performed better on remembering, (2) only the weaker students benefited fromthe aid on understanding (Leisle et al., 2012; Spanjers et al., 2011), and (3) with the aid was a better design thanwithout on analyzing.ICLS 2016 Proceedings155© ISLSParticipants and designWe invited 140 senior secondary level students aged from 16 to 18 years from a Hong Kong school to participatethis study. Only 123 (around 60% boys) completed the experiments. We also invited two teachers in the schoolto conduct the experiments. A 2 x 2 between subjects factorial design with the factors prior knowledge (weakervs stronger) and visual aid (with vs without) was used. This resulted in the four experimental conditions – 30weaker students learning with the aid, 32 weaker students learning without the aid, 31 stronger students learningwith the aid, and 30 stronger students learning without the aid.MaterialsThis experiment included learning material and a posttest. We used the learning materials of Chiu and Churchill(2015b), see their online video in the experiment and Figure 1. The materials were developed using Mayermultimedia learning design principles under a design-based approach. The design aims to maximize learnercognitive capacity. Moreover, the visual aid design, evolved from variation theory, presented different forms of aquadratic equation and its different solving methods, and the four-section presentation – graph, equation, solvingmethod and description. The description and solving method sections demonstrated the relationships between thegraph and equation sections.Figure 1. The material in the treatment group.In the posttest, the questions were tested in the study of Chiu and Churchill (2015a). The questionsassessed remembering (retention, level 1 in Anderson, Krathwohl, & Bloom, 2001), understanding (transfer, level2) and analyzing (transfer, level 4). In the questions of remembering, students were required to write down thevalue(s) of roots and discriminant of a graph, see Figure 2; in that of understanding, the students were asked toidentify graph(s) of a quadratic equation or a condition; and in the analyzing questions, students were required toconsider two pairs of statements or expressions and decide whether they were related (or true) or not related (orfalse). Each of the questions was scored out of 1; and each skill was scored out of 12.RememberingWhat arethe values of roots of an equation f(x)=0?What is the sign of the discriminant of an equation f(x)=0?ICLS 2016 Proceedings156© ISLSUnderstandingWhich of the following graph is y=ax2+bx+c if when a<0?AnalyzingStatement or expression 1△=b2–4acvalue of aStatement or expression 2Determines number of x-interceptsDetermines shape of the function y=ax2+bx+c.Figure 2. Questions used in the post-test.ProcedureWe first got the consent of the principal, teachers and parents. A pilot study was used to determine the timeallowed for learning tasks. Before the experiment, the students completed an online 10-minute multiple-choicequestion quiz. The students were divided into the four experimental conditions based on a median split using thequiz scores obtained in the pretest (Kalyuga, 2007). We conducted the experiments in a computer room. In theexperiments, the students were assigned to an individual seat in front of a personal computer. We first briefedthem on the procedure of the experiment, and explained how to control the materials and what they would learnfrom the learning activities. The students had 40 minutes to manipulate the multimedia materials assigned, tounderstand the relationships between the graph and equation for learning. After the experiment, the studentscompleted the posttests in 30 minutes.ResultsA t-test analysis showed that there was a significant difference between the weaker and stronger learner groupsin the quiz, all p values <0.001. This showed that stronger group had significant better skills to remember, applyand analyze graphical representations of algebraic equations.We conducted univariate ANOVAs with remembering, understanding and analyzing as dependentvariables. The results of Levene's tests, all p values >0.05, indicated that all dependent variables met theassumption of homogeneity of variance. Means and standard deviations for scores of the three skills for bothweaker and stronger students were shown in Table 1.Table 1.

There was no main effect of multimediadesign, F(1, 119) = 3.722, p =0.056, partial η2 =0.03, nor was there a multimedia design by prior knowledge, F(1,119) = 0.339, p =0.561, partial η2 <0.01.With regard to the dependent variable understanding, univariate ANOVAs showed that there was nosignificant effect of multimedia design, F(1,119) = 2.60, p =0.110, partial η2 =0.021. A significant main effectwas found for prior knowledge, F(1, 119) = 17.96, p < 0.001, partial η2 =0.13, such that the stronger group (M =8.00, SD = 1.62) outperformed the weaker group (M = 6.85, SD = 1.40). A significant interaction effect wasfound, F(1, 119) = 5.52, p =0.020, partial η2 =0.04, see Figure 3. A significant simple effect was found for theweaker group who learned better with the aid, F(1, 60) = 10.12, p=0.002, partial η2 =0.144; a significant simpleeffect was for the stronger group who learned better without the aid, F(1, 59) = 0.22, p=0.32 (one-tailed), partialη2 =0.004. A significant simple effect was found for the multimedia design without the aid, such that the strongerICLS 2016 Proceedings157© ISLSgroup learned better than the weaker group, F(1, 60) = 20.78, p<0.001, partial η2 =0.257; no simple effect wasfound for the material design with the aid, F(1, 59) = 1.87, p=0.177, partial η2 =0.031.Figure 3. The interaction between prior knowledge and visual aid on remembering.Note: Design 1 – with aid; 2 – without aid. Prior 1 – novice group; 2 – advanced group.For dependent variable analyzing, a two-way ANOVA indicated there was a significant main effect ofmultimedia design, F(1, 119) = 34.55, p<0.001, partial η2 =0.225. The groups learned better with the aid (M=7.11,SD=1.32) rather than without the aid (M=5.83, SD=1.11). No significant effects were found for either priorknowledge, F(1, 119) = 3.09, p=0.082, partial η2 =0.025, or interaction effect, F(1, 119) = 0.23, p=0.633, partialη2 =0.002.Overall, these results show that the aid have negative effects on the stronger group when developingunderstanding skills in multimedia environments, but not for remembering and analyzing.Discussion and conclusionThe experiment reported in this paper was designed to investigate the effect of the instructional visual aid that isdesigned using variation theory and four-section representation in digital multimedia learning environments formathematics students with different levels of prior knowledge on different order thinking skills – remembering,understanding and analyzing skills. The goal of this study was to investigate prior knowledge and visual aid onremembering, understanding and analyzing for secondary level algebra in multimedia learning.The results of remembering and understanding supported the studies of Leslie and colleagues (2012),and Rey and Fischer (2013). Remembering was influenced by prior knowledge. The stronger group rememberedbetter than the weaker group, suggesting the visual aid is not necessary for facilitating remembering. Onunderstanding, the weaker group who received the aid outperformed those weaker students did not receive theaid. In contrast, the stronger group who received the aid performed less well than the strong group who did notreceive the aid. These results suggest that the aid did help the weaker group see the relationships between theequation and the graph to understand the properties of the graph better. The description section in the aid, whichmay be seen as an explanation, directly explained the relationship between the graph and equation. The sectionappeared to be redundant for the stronger group who may have stronger graphical property skills. Processing theaid was extraneous processing in working memory and thereby reduced cognitive capacity available for otherprocessing. Therefore, this demonstrates that for weaker group, graphs and equations might be facilitated by theinclusion of a visual instructional aid that facilitates essential processing. Also demonstrated was that the samevisual aid had negative consequences for stronger group.The results further showed that the with the aid group outperformed the without group in developinganalyzing. A plausible explanation is that the learning task for analyzing involved heavier cognitive processing.The analysis questions required the students to justify if there were any relationships between pairs of statements.The students were required to see the connections among most multimedia messages when the learned with thematerial, which became less structured environment. The cognitive process in this environment is heavierICLS 2016 Proceedings158© ISLS(Nievelstein et al., 2013) for both weaker and stronger students. The students would need more help to connectmultimedia messages for constructing a more complete understanding. Processing the aid that may provideessential information could be necessary for all the students, therefore, the aid were not be redundant for thestronger students, but facilitated essential processing.Implications and suggestionsThe findings also show multimedia materials were more effective when designed for learners of different levelsof prior knowledge (Kaluga, 2014; Mayer, 2009) and order thinking skills. The studies have three implications.First, the findings confirmed that the visual aid format – variations and multiple representations – were moreeffective for weaker students in understanding. The aid explained the relationships between graphs and equations,and thereby helped weaker students have better understanding algebra (see Leslie et al., 2012; Rey & Fischer,2013) in multimedia learning. Second, if not carefully orchestrated in order thinking skill, students of differentprior knowledge may not receive the best design. In our experiment, for weaker students, the aid was moreeffective in understanding compared to analyzing and remembering. There may have better designs forremembering and analyzing skill development. As discussed before, numerous experimental studies support theeffects of prior knowledge on multimedia learning, but most of them did not consider higher orders of thinkingskills. Our findings suggested that the order of thinking skills could influence the effects of prior knowledge onthe instructional design in multimedia learning. Third, processing the aid for higher order thinking skills canfacilitate essential processing for better learning outcomes. In other words, designs that are ineffective for strongerlearners in structured tasks may become effective for them in less structure tasks.The results also afford two suggestions. First, multimedia presentation designs should consider orderthinking skill and prior knowledge. Using order thinking skills to identify instructional formats or procedurescan balance the degree of guidance offered to learners. Second, in algebra learning, providing graphs andequations can be enough for students when developing remembering, but when developing understanding, anaid should be added to weaker students only. An aid should be included for all the students when developing thehigher order thinking skill of analyzing.In conclusion, the findings can contribute to the design principal for learner prior knowledge inmultimedia learning, such as Kalyuga (2014) and Mayer (2009). One multimedia learning design cannot fit alllearners of different prior knowledge levels (Kalyuga, 2007, 2009, 2014, Mayer, 2009). This study furthersuggests that one multimedia learning design also cannot fit all different order thinking skills. Instructionaldesigns for the weaker learners may become useful for the stronger learners when developing higher order ofthinking skills that require higher cognitive processing.Limitations and future directionsThe present findings are also relevant to adaptive digital multimedia learning environments. Multimedialearning will be used in many adaptive learning environments (Van Merrienboer & Sweller, 2005) in the future.Most studies suggest using learner behavior, characteristics and prior knowledge (Astleitner & Wiesner, 2004;Chiu, 2016; Chiu & Churchill, 2015c; Kalyuga, 2006, 2008) to modify the environment or to give personalizedfeedback to learners. This present study suggests that the adaptive environment should include order thinkingskills and learner prior knowledge to identify multimedia presentations or tasks for delivery to promoteindividual learning.It is important to better evaluate the effects of instructional designs and learner prior knowledge levelon different order thinking skills. The results of the present experiment could also be extended by additionalstudies on other higher order thinking or in other subject domains.Overall, future research on adaptive learning environments should focus on cognitive processing, andinteractions among learner prerequisites, multimedia presentations and learning outcomes.ReferencesAnderson, L.
