Based on social cognitive theory, this study proposes twodynamic CSCL models of learning using understudied factors – system functionality, socialability, collective efficacy and social interaction – to examine mediation and causalrelationships among these constructs and their influence on learning. The models are testedusing data collected from a large US university. Specifically, while the predictive constructsare operationalized through the survey instruments, outcome measures are modeled usingelectronic trace data and actual evaluation information. Data is analyzed via the Partial LeastSquares method. Results demonstrate close relatedness among the constructs and a differentinfluencing mechanism on learning for each. The addition of social interaction as a factor tothe learning model increases predictability of student learning as compared to models withoutthis factor. The paper concludes with discussion of the implications of this study.Keywords: CSCL, social ability, collective efficacy, social interaction, PLSIntroductionResearchers have taken considerable effort to understand the factors affecting student achievement in computersupported collaborative learning (CSCL). Previous studies, however, have investigated these factors from moreor less isolated perspectives. Kirschner and Erkens (2013) classified these perspectives into three categories:pedagogy, technology, and human factors. From pedagogical point of view, Shaw (2013) studied group sizesand the impact on programming language learning. Jackson et al. (2013) explored the effect of interactivetabletops on elementary students’ mathematical achievement. From a human factors perspective, Joksimovic etal. (2014) reported how individual differences (e.g., working memory) influenced perceived cognitive presencein communities of inquiry. These approaches, despite their contributions to our understanding of CSCL to date,have overlooked emergent dynamics created by multiple factors across categories. For example, one mightquestion how groups perceive pedagogies and technologies to experience of agency, social interaction, andlearning. Given that CSCL builds on person-environmental reciprocity in socio-technical systems (c.f., Bandura,1986), it is important to examine internal forces and synergies that result from interactions among multiplefactors, including pedagogy, technology, and human factors.The current study, therefore, proposes and validates a model of learning that sheds light on dynamicsacross several factors that are particularly understudied in CSCL. Specifically, with inspiration from socialcognitive theory, we examine how cognitive factors—social ability and collective efficacy—influence studentlearning while mediating the impact of technological environments—system functionality—on learningoutcomes. Social ability, the perceived individual capacity to perform well within social-technical systems, is afitness measure among task, technology and people (Yang et al., 2006). It is a factor not captured by previousapproaches isolating pedagogy, technology and human factors. Few studies have investigated how social abilitycorrelates with other factors to influence CSCL. Similarly, Bandura (2000) suggested that collective efficacy,the group’s shared belief that it can execute a task successfully, has positive impact on various aspects of grouplearning and performance. There is, however, little research examining the role of collective efficacy in CSCL.Introducing social ability and collective efficacy and constructing a dynamic model of learning with them hasthe potential to improve our understanding of how learning takes place in CSCL.We further build an alternative model to examine how these factors (system functionality, socialability, and collective efficacy) are ultimately embodied as social interaction behavior influencing studentlearning outcomes. This model specifies social cognitive theory’s triadic reciprocity of environment-cognitionbehavior in CSCL. For example, system functionality is measured as task-specific support. Social ability ismeasured as the fit between person, task, and tools in CSCL. The second model aims to illustrate the influencingprocess of these factors on social behavior and learning, and outperforms the first model in predicting andexplaining learning.CSCL 2015 Proceedings276© ISLSTheoretical background and research modelsSocial cognitive theory (Bandura, 1986) builds on reciprocal determinism, which indicates that environmentsand persons influence and shape each other. Environmental factors refer to social and physical characteristics—system functionality in our study. Human factors represent 1) psychological characteristics such as knowledge,beliefs, and emotion and 2) their involvement in cognitive and social events. With inspiration from socialcognitive theory, we consecutively built two CSCL models of learning to explore and elaborate CSCLdynamics. System functionality (SF), social ability (SA), collective efficacy (CE) and social interaction (ITRA)are exogenous or/and mediation variables. Learning performance (LP) is an endogenous variable. Table 1presents each model.Table 1: Research modelsModel 1Model 2Model 1Previous CSCL studies rarely considered psychological characteristics among human factors (Joksimovic et al.,2014). Our first model highlights how environmental impact is mediated by beliefs related to ability at bothindividual and group levels to influence student learning. First, the construct of social ability is a syntheticrepresentation of individuals’ beliefs about their capacity to learn within a surrounding environments’ socialaffordances. Yang et al. (2006) suggested a social ability measure for online group learning contexts comprisedof five factors: social navigation, peer social presence, instructor social presence, written communication, andcomfort in sharing personal information. Social navigation indicates that students can perform well due to thevisibility of actions of other students in the online system (c.f., Dourish, 1999). Social presence reflects studentconfidence in social interaction. Clear communication through writing is an especially crucial factor for studentsuccess in asynchronous online learning. Finally, in a less private space, learners may feel uncomfortable insharing some types of information, which in turn affects the interaction between group members. Instead ofbeing a single dimension measure, social ability captures intricate effects of the interaction between person, taskand tool. Social ability is previously shown to be a significant predictor of online learning satisfaction andparticipation pattern change; students with higher social ability move from peripheral to central roles in anonline CSCL courses (Tsai et al, 2008). We therefore assume a positive relationship between social ability andlearning outcome:H1: Social ability has a significant positive effect on student learning.Social cognitive theory posits efficacy, belief in one's own ability to complete tasks, as an importantfactor that guides human behavior. Research on efficacy has been essentially confined to self-efficacy exercisedindividually. However, this is not the only way in which a person can bring an impact on learning. Bandura(2000) suggested extending the notion of self-efficacy to collective efficacy. It is a notion that exits in the mindof group members, or group’s shared beliefs in its conjoined capabilities to execute the actions required toachieve common goals (Bandura, 2000). Perceived collective efficacy is particularly relevant when the goalachievement requires a massive amount of interdependent efforts, which is usually the case in CSCL. Lent,Schmidt and Schmidt (2006) conducted an experiment to show that collective efficacy is even a strongerpredictor of team performance than self-efficacy. Hence, collective efficacy is held to be an importantdeterminant of student learning in CSCL:	  H2: Collective efficacy has a significant positive effect on student learning.CSCL 2015 Proceedings277© ISLSThe quality and usefulness of the technological systems is a fundamental determinant of effectiveonline learning (Schwier, 2002). Therefore, system functionality is considered as a base factor influencinglearning. System functionality in our case is the perceived ability of the environment to provide task-specificsupport, problem solving, and collaboration. Without quality system provisions (e.g., communication channels),students may feel isolated and depowered to accomplish the scheduled tasks. In Schwier (2002)’s study,therefore, system functionality was crucial to building online learning communities. As a foundationalinfrastructure for students to be social, we assume system functionality will affect students’ perceived socialability:	  H3: System functionality significantly influences social abilitySimilarly, the technological environment serves as a determinant of collective efficacy. Socialcognitive theory posits that past success, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, and physiological cues (c.f.,Bandura, 1986). We assume that system functionality can promote collective efficacy by providing effectivecommunication channels, which make visible other students’ success traces, support group regulation, andenable peer encouragements (c.f., Kirschner & Erkens 2013) :	  H4: System functionality has a significant positive effect collective efficacy.Model 2Social cognitive theory also emphasizes that the person behavior (i.e., involvement in cognitive and socialevents) embodies psychological characteristics to influence the social environment. In the same vein, our secondmodel adds social interaction to the first model to mediate paths between belief in ability and student learning.Social interaction in the current study is modeled as individual contribution to in-group dialogues encompassingpeer interaction and student-to-instructor interaction. First, social interaction is important process mechanisms inCSCL (Stahl, 2006). As a key factor of success in CSCL, we assume that social interaction not only promotescognitive processes in collaboration (e.g., reasoning, critical thinking, and reflection) but also develop positiveaffective relationships, which directly influence learning (c.f., Yang et al., 2006):H5: Social interaction has a significant positive influence on student learning.As a behavioral factor, social interaction also mediates social ability and collective efficacy toinfluence learning. As a positive learning climate encourages exchanges of opinions and information (Wu,Tennyson & Hsia, 2010), we assume strong ability beliefs reflecting positive social affordances will contributeto efforts invested by students to collaborate and interact during CSCL:H6: Social ability has a significant positive influence on interaction.H7: Collective efficacy has a significant positive influence on interaction.This second model is expected to outperform the first model in explaining student learning variances inthe CSCL context.MethodsResearch contextThe data reported in this paper represent a subset of data gathered in a larger study conducted in the context ofan online graduate student course on Computer Support for Collaborative Learning, offered in a large midwestern US university. Twenty-four students were divided into eight small groups at the end of the first week ofan eight week summer session and completed all course activities in the context of that small group for theremaining seven weeks of the course. The collaborative environment that supported the CSCL course was Sakai.The CANS (http://www.cansaware.org) system was also applied to provide activity awareness information.When a student logged into Sakai and posted a message or read a message, CANS logged the informationautomatically. Specifically, the data we analyzed from Week 5 and Week 6, where the group activity is todesign a two day online learning module consisting of three parts: scenario, script and assessment. Survey datawere collected before Week 5 and the log data from CANS were gathered after week 6 when the module wascompleted.MeasuresAll instruments were adapted from existing literature to increase validity. Social ability is measured via thesocial ability survey composed of 5 constructs developed by Yang et al. (2006). Collective efficacy wasoperationalized through a 4-item survey constructed by Hardin et al (2006) for virtual teams. Systemfunctionality was informed by Sonnenwald’s (2005) information horizons concept about how a person perceivesCSCL 2015 Proceedings278© ISLSthe usefulness of an environment that was adapted to Sakai including 5 items. The system functionality waspresented to students with a five-point Likert scale, and the other two are with a seven-point Likert scale.Most previous studies applied self-reported questionnaires to reflect student learning performanceconstruct (e.g. Yang et al., 2006; Wu, Tennyson & Hsia, 2010). However, a common bias exists if independentvariables (social ability, collective efficacy, system functionality) and dependent variables (social interactionand student learning performance) are reported by the same individuals. To avoid such a bias, this study appliedactual assignment and evaluation data to generate measures for student learning. The purpose of the moduleanalyzed was for group members to develop an online module that can be implemented in a real-lifeenvironment. Two raters proceeded to evaluate the three work products – scenario, script, and assessment – andgenerate a group grade based on the rubric. Each individual student was then asked to rate and nominate theirgroup members and the whole class. The frequency of rating from other group members or other students isconsidered a reflection of the individual grade. Therefore, student learning performance is represented by twoindicators – group and individual grade.In this study, social interaction is approached from a network theory perspective. Individuals mustsocialize to form a group which shares goals and values. The way individuals are situated in social networks,i.e., the structure of groups, significantly affects the creation of social capital (Cho et al., 2007). Studentsoccupying structurally advantageous positions have a better opportunity to influence others, and thus play amore important role in the social space. In network analysis, degree centrality has been used to examine theadvantageous positions of individuals. Persons with high degree centrality are assumed to be more active andinfluential due to the many ties and connections they have with others in the social structure (Freeman, 1979).From the perspective of graph theory, degree centrality is a quantification of the relative importance of a nodewithin the graph. It indicates the number of links the student has with other students in the course.Partial least squares (PLS) modelingPLS method is a multivariate statistical modeling technique used to test the relationships between a set ofindependent variables and dependent variables. It is considered to be the second generation of multivariateanalysis (Fornell & Larcker, 1982), integrating multiple regression, path analysis, principle component analysis,and multiple discriminant analysis. As a component-based structural equation modeling technique, PLS isparticularly suitable for predicative applications, while the linear structure relationships (LISREL) model ismore oriented towards theory testing and development.Normality assumption is not required for PLS, and the technique shows utility even with small samplesizes (Chin Marcolin & Newsted, 1996). By conducting a Monte Carlo simulation study on PLS with smallsamples, Chin, et al. (1996) found that the PLS approach can offer information about the appropriateness ofindicators for sample sizes as low as 20 and even under the condition that the number of variables surpasses thenumber of observations. Fornell and Bookstein (1982) states that “PLS involves no assumptions about thepopulation or scale of measurement and consequently works without distributional assumptions and withnominal, ordinal, and interval scaled variables” (p. 443). Considering the relatively small sample size and theexplanatory nature of the study, the PLS method is preferred for model testing in this study.ResultsMeasure modelsThis study applied two-step analysis. The measurement model was first estimated and re-specified and then thestructural model. Tables 2 and 3 demonstrate the results for the measurement models. In terms of individualitem reliability, Chin (1998) indicated that items should load highly (greater than 0.7) on their intendedconstructs. Loadings with 0.5 or 0.6 are still acceptable on the condition that there are additional indicators inthe construct for comparison analysis (Chin, 1998). As a result, items such as Item 4 in system functionality,Item 2, 3, 7 in social ability, and Item 1 in collective efficacy were removed according to the criteria. Then allthe factor loadings of the measurements (Table 2) met the suggested condition.To evaluate the internal consistency and construct reliability, composite reliability was calculated. Assuggested by Nunnally (1978), composite reliability should be greater than 0.7, which most of constructs in thisstudy satisfied (Table 2). The learning performance construct was close to 0.7 and is generally consideredacceptable in social science. Regarding convergent validity, it was suggested that the average variance extracted(AVE) for each factor should be larger than 0.5. Table 2 shows the values of AVEs meet the recommendation.Discriminant validity is valid if the squared root of AVE is greater than the correlations between latent variables(Fornell & Larcker, 1982). Table 3 indicates that all the scales meet the suggested requirements to indicate anadequate level measurement validity.CSCL 2015 Proceedings279© ISLSTable 2: Item loadings, construct reliability and convergent validityConstructComposite reliabilityAVEItemLoadingSystem Functionality0.880.73Social Ability0.920.57Collective Efficacy0.730.64InteractionLearning Performance1.000.661.000.55SF1SF2SF3SF5SA5SA6SA9SA14SA15SA16SA18SA19SA21SA28CE2CE3CE4INTRLP1LP2	  0.930.780.820.880.800.790.740.690.900.640.880.700.790.580.890.780.731.000.990.79AVE = Average Variance Extracted	  	  Table 3: Discriminant validity.ConstructSFSACESystem Functionality0.85Social Ability0.470.76Collective Efficacy0.280.220.80Interaction0.530.370.31INTRLP1.00Learning Performance0.690.280.290.580.74Diagonal elements (bold) are the square root of the AVE of each construct.Structural models: Direct effectsThe explained variance (R2) in the endogenous variables and the significance of the coefficients are theindicators of model performance (Chin, 1998). For Model 1, as shown in Table 4 (a), social ability had apositive relation to learning performance (0.48, p < .05) and therefore supported H1. However, H2 was notsupported since collective efficacy had no significant relationship with student learning. Again, systemfunctionality had a significantly association with social ability but not with collective efficacy. The explained R2for student learning in Model 1 was 0.24.In terms of Model 2, H3 and H4 obtained the same results as in Model 1 showing that systemfunctionality significantly influenced social ability but not collective efficacy. However, both social ability(0.46, p<.05) and collective efficacy (0.41, p<.05) had significant associations with social interactionsupporting H5 and H6. Social ability was a more influential factor on social interaction than collective efficacy.Again, social interaction influenced learning performance significantly (0.58, p<.01). The social interactionfactor was more influential than social ability on learning performance when we compared path coefficientsacross Model 1 and 2. Moreover, the R2 in Model 2 was 0.33, which was higher than 0.24 in Model 1.Therefore, Model 2 has better predicting performance of student learning than Model 1.CSCL 2015 Proceedings280© ISLSTable 4: Model performance4 (a)Model 14 (b)Model 2Dashed lines represent no significant relationship. **p < .05, ***p < .01.Structural models: Mediation analysisWe further examined indirect, mediation effects in Model 2. Baron and Kenny (1986) suggested three steps toexamine mediation effects: a) the independent variable must be significantly correlated with the mediator; b) theindependent variable must be significantly correlated with the dependent variable; c) both the independentvariable and mediator should be employed to predict the dependent variable. If both independent value andmediator significantly explain the dependent variable, then this mediator partially mediate the effect of theindependent variable on the dependent variable. If only the mediator is significant, then the mediator fullymediated the independent variable effect on dependent variable.

Then the link between system functionality and learning performance wassignificant meeting the second condition. The direct link between system functionality and learning performancebecomes insignificant when controlling for the link between social ability and learning performance. Therefore,social ability fully mediated the relationship between system functionality and student learning performance.Using the same logic, social interaction did not mediate the relationship between social ability and learningperformance. Again social interaction did not mediate the relationship between collective efficacy and learningperformance.Conclusions and implicationsInformed by social cognitive theory, this study built two different CSCL models of learning especiallycontributing to the understanding of the role of social ability, collective efficacy and social interaction in CSCL.The results revealed that system functionality significantly influenced students’ social ability, which again fullymediated the system functionality effect on student learning. Social ability also showed a significant effect onstudent learning. However, system functionality did not affect collective efficacy significantly, and collectiveefficacy had no significant influence on student learning. Both social ability and collective efficacy hadsignificant effects on social interaction, but social ability was a more influential predictor for social interaction.Finally, social interaction significantly impacted student learning performance and served as a stronger predictorthan social ability in explaining student learning. Social interaction, however, did not mediate the influence ofsocial ability and collective efficacy on learning.To sum up, the addition of the social interaction factor (Model 2) increased the predictive power of ourmodel of student learning over the model without it (Model 1). Social interaction alone had the strongest impactCSCL 2015 Proceedings281© ISLSon student learning, which is well supported by CSCL literature. In addition, when students were supported bywell functioning environments, which also impacted on social ability, students were more likely to interact witheach other and tended to have higher learning performance. Technology designs focused on supporting learningactivities as well as fluid social interaction, therefore, appear to enhance learning overall.However, linkage between beliefs about ability and learning was not evident. Though beliefs aboutability had significant direct effects on social interaction, results failed to prove beliefs about ability can reachfar to impact student learning outcomes. The results may be explained by two reasons. First of all, CSCL studiesfrequently report free-rider effects when some students do not contribute to group works. It might be the casewhen students believe their group members outperform themselves, they may not be willing to exert their bestefforts (Piezon, 2005); therefore, collective efficacy may not guarantee successful student learning outcomes.Also, it should be noted this study utilized degree centrality as a social interaction measure. Though degreecentrality impacts learning significantly, different attributes of interaction might be considered to mediate abilitybeliefs and impact on student learning. For example, a student in a central role may or may not be contributingto the learning of others. In this case, how one student disseminates important information and how othermembers rely on this student (i.e., betweenness centrality) may be a critical indicator of quality interaction.Future research may examine how to build a social interaction measure that integrates both the quantitative andqualitative aspects of information and incorporates it into the proposed model of learning and test its effect.The findings of this study are important in that previous studies found the direct effects of socialability, collective efficacy, and system functionality on student learning mostly not controlling for or explainingother factors. But it seems that dynamics among these factors are far more complex than reported. The reportedstudy enriches literature on student learning in CSCL by providing new insights into the influencingmechanisms of these factors. Methodologically, previous studies have only used self-reported data to measureall the constructs used in the model. However, self-reported participation or evaluation instrument may notaddress the student performance appropriately and can be different from the actual case (Tsai et al, 2008).Moreover, the potential of common method bias exists if both independent and dependent variables are selfreported by the same persons. Unlike those works, the present study applied actual evaluation of the studentworks as the learning performance indicator, in alignment with Goggins’ (2009, 2013a, 2013b, in press) andXing’s (2014a, 2014b, 2014c, 2014d, 2015a, 2015b) data analytics approaches to the examination of trace data,“Group Informatics”. In addition, this study took advantage of the advancement of information systems bymodeling student social interaction using electronic trace data informed by network theory. Our studydemonstrates a potential approach to measure the constructs in CSCL studies and possibly with more validityand objectivity.ReferencesBandura, A. (1986).
