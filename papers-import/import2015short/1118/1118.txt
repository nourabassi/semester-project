Five posters encapsulate several projects, addressing the role of physical orlocational elements within our work, including their role in the pedagogical design, thespecific measures collected, and representations employed. The first two projects instrumentthe classroom with location-specific technologies (e.g., RFID tags), enabling learners toexplore location-dependent phenomena (e.g., an earthquake zone, squirrel food patches). Thethird project maps classroom inquiry discourse (i.e., digital notes) to spatially meaningfullocations though out the classroom for collective knowledge mapping. The fourth and fifthprojects require learners to consider the physical properties of their learning environment inorder to make decisions concerning where they will place motion-activated cameras forwildlife field investigations, allowing learners to instrument the learning environmentthemselves.Keywords: physical location, location-tracking technologies, instrumented learning environmentsIntroductionThere is a long tradition amongst educators to situate learning within a physical orientation in the classroom,through the use of stations (e.g., in elementary classrooms), value lines (i.e., where students are asked to stand ina location that corresponds to their opinion or other value), or even small groups working on specific themes atdifferent table locations. While most classroom instruction remains in the form of lecture (Tapscott, 1998),where location is largely (but not totally!) irrelevant, these longstanding examples have served as a persistentreminder that the physical space of the classroom can be used in pedagogically meaningful ways. A new genreof networked technologies is emerging that can track location and identity, or capture a variety of sensorinformation. These have opened the doors to new ways of leveraging the physical environment for purposes oflearning, creating a new set of interactions with which learners can engage. For example, in BeeSim, studentswear a “ForagerBee” glove – a sensor-embedded wearable – to step into the role of a bee and contribute to thehealth of a “hive” through location-specific actions within the environment (Peppler et al., 2010). Students aimto make optimal foraging choices, such as moving to flowers (fitted with unique resistors) that have the greatestnectar yield and returning to the hive before their “bee” is (virtually) exhausted.This session will present a set of coherent projects that have pushed the boundaries of suchapplications, instrumenting students such that the physical environment can tailor its response to their presenceat different locations, or allowing students to instrument their own physical environment. This set of projectshas been conducted across a three-year time span, at several different school settings, with research groups fromtwo universities. It represents a collaboration of theoretical perspectives and technology frameworks to achievea unique set of curricular interactions. We have instrumented our classrooms to capture and distribute studentideas, to identify and respond to individual students, or to simulate data collection within a scientificcommunity. The emphasis of our work is on science inquiry, with a particular interest in collective forms ofCSCL 2015 Proceedings631© ISLSprogress, where students work autonomously within a larger “whole class” context, aggregating theirobservations or evidence to advance the understanding or progress within the overall community.We organize our session as a structured poster set in order to accommodate five projects, giving eachproject a short presentation, but allowing the audience considerable time to interact with the authors. Eachposter will address the role of physical or locational elements within its work, including the role of suchelements in the pedagogical design, the specific measures collected, and representations employed. Ourdiscussant Kylie Peppler from Indiana University will serve as discussant, offering comments during the finalfifteen minutes of the symposium.Location matters: The use of classroom space in RoomQuakeTom Moher, Alessandro Gnoli, and Brenda López SilvaRoomQuake is a multi-week seismology unit designed for enactment in grade 5 and 6 classrooms. The unitproblematizes the issue of how scientists are able to determine the properties of remote events—in this case,earthquakes. In RoomQuake, the classroom is imagined to be a miniature version of an earthquake-richgeographic area, and classroom computers situated around the room serve as imitation seismographs (Figure 1,left). During the first few weeks of the unit, earthquakes can be invoked "on demand" as students explore therelationships between the properties of earthquakes (time, location, and magnitude) and the representation oflocal ground vibration on seismograms. Over the final few weeks of the unit, students apply theseunderstandings to determine the properties of a series of "roomquakes" occurring in their classroom.In RoomQuake, location matters. When roomquakes occur, they occur at a particular location in theroom. The energy transmitted through the ground (the floor of the classroom) travels to the seismographs at aconstant speed. Seismograms of the same earthquake will look differently, if they were produced at differentdistances from the event. Students engage in activities such as (1) estimating the relative distances of differentseismographs from an earthquake (based on arrival times or seismogram amplitudes) and using those estimatesto qualitatively estimate the epicenter of an earthquake, (2) determining the speed of an earthquake wave frontusing tape measures and stopwatches, and (3) enacting a room-size version of the mathematical process oftrilateration by finding the common point of intersection among multiple circles using tape measures anchoredat each seismograph. In each of these, the floor of the classroom becomes a two-dimensional stage for therepresentation of the phenomenon and the enactment of activities (estimation, measurement, trilateration)common to the practice of seismology.Figure 1. Left: Simulated seismograph. Right: Aggregate public display of seismogram readings.In prior quasi-experimental research, we found that students who enacted RoomQuake activities on theclassroom floor evidenced more improvement in both practice skills and conceptual understandings thanstudents who performed analogous activities using maps (Moher et al., 2010). We expect that the benefits ofphysical enactment might derive from a variety of sources, including novelty, increased opportunities for socialinteraction, greater play value, salience at larger scale, or cognitive benefits associated with pairing action andthought.Prior versions of RoomQuake included only the latter part of the current unit. Students were taught tointerpret seismograms and extract earthquake parameters, but did not develop strong understandings of thecapabilities and limitations of seismographs or their dependence on the generation of multiple waves of differentconstant speeds during an earthquake. The new design introduces a knowledge-building progression in the formof a series of challenges to learners to determine characteristics of earthquakes and waves using a variety ofCSCL 2015 Proceedings632© ISLStools: seismographs, tape measures, and stop watches. The classroom floor becomes an experimental space, and"control" of the simulation technology is inverted; in this phase, roomquakes come at the discretion of theteacher (or even student), not according to a schedule, and the earthquake parameters—time, location, andmagnitude—are specified by the user, not the goal of inquiry.We also changed the activity structure of the second phase of the unit. In prior versions, students weretypically organized as teams responsible for reporting a consensus reading from specific seismograph. In thenew version, students use mobile devices to individually report readings from multiple seismographs, and as thereadings are reported in aggregated form on a public display, affording learners an indicator of activity andprogress in their spatially distributed work. Included in that visualization is a map of the room showing thedistance estimates from each seismogram, reinforcing the "intersection of circles" framing that is difficult toachieve at classroom scale because of the occluding walls (Figure 1, right).Expanding the pedagogical design space with indoor spatial technologiesAnthony Perritano, Alessandro Gnoli, and Tom MoherWe are interested in expanding the space of pedagogical designs by leveraging current advancements in indoorlocation tracking technologies such as Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID), inductive and capacitive NearField Communication (NFC), and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) iBeacons in technology-augmented classroomlearning environments. They introduce the notion of a proxemic interaction, which is defined by the HumanComputer Interaction research community as a way to describe an individual’s technology-enhanced, sociallymediated, micro-located actions within a physical space (Marquardt & Greenberg, 2012).Within learning environments that utilize spatial technologies, location has a meaning, which canbecome an input or information source for learning activities within an indoor classroom. In our investigations,location becomes an input into a participatory simulation and inquiry-based knowledge building activities(Slotta, 2014).The affordances that location-tracking technologies add to classroom learning environments can becategorized in three ways: (1) hotspot location tracking—student movement can be detected in and out ofdiscrete activity hotspots or zones; (2) distance tracking—discrete points within the classroom are able to detect,track, and compute distances of students in its proximity, and (3) high resolution tracking— student exactlocation within the classroom can be tracked continuously in real-time, making student-position an input intonew types of learning activity designs. Distance tracking could potentially exchange information with thestudent or reveal an interaction (Marquardt, Ballendat, Boring, Greenberg, & Hinckley, 2012).We used indoor location-tracking technologies and concepts within a classroom participatorysimulation called Hunger Games (Moher et al., 2013). Hunger Games engages learners as foragers in anenvironment consisting of several food patches. Students learn the fundamentals of game theory by enactingstrategies for survival under optimal game conditions: patch depletion, predation, safety in numbers, etc.Students employed small plush animals or "avatars" with embedded RFID tags to forage, choosing among foodpatches that were distributed around the room (see Figure 2).Our choice of indoor location-tracking technology (i.e., RFID tags and readers) had an interestingoutcome and created interaction opportunities that we did not anticipate. In our original design, we envisionedthat we would track the location of individual students using bracelets or lanyards, with hotspot locationtracking. However, this approach proved to be unreliable and technically difficult due to signal overlap from theRFID readers, which produced too much attenuation and false positive detection. To overcome this issue wetuned down the RFID readers’ signal to a smaller range (< 30 cm) around the patches. We outfitted each studentwith an avatar (i.e., a plush toy that that served as an information carrier of his or her accumulated calorieinformation throughout the simulation) and required that those avatars be placed directly on top of the patches(i.e.., RFID readers). First, students developed affective connections with their avatar (observable by kissing,hugging, etc.; Moher et al., 2011). Two, students had the ability to both participate as an agent in the simulation(by placing their avatar in an optimal food patch) and to be an observer in a meta-role (by walking over toinformation displays that showed their progress within the game). With this freedom to roam, students moved todisplays that showed their score while their avatars were feeding.We used location as an informational source for students for: (1) reflection-in-action during foragingbouts, with the aid of large public ambient displays that provided information about total calorie accumulationfor each animal, patch utilization, and a real-time map of each animal’s location; and (2) reflection-on-action inpost-foraging activities supported through community knowledge-building tools.CSCL 2015 Proceedings633© ISLSFigure 2.

Right: Student moving betweenfood patch and large display.In summary, we described the conceptual and practical use of indoor spatial technologies within aclassroom environment. We discussed the affordances that these technologies create, e.g. the notion of microlocational proxemic interactions, which have the potential to serve as informational inputs into learningactivities. Finally, classroom use of these spatial technologies is still at the outset. Our experiences could helpinform the educational technology developer community (e.g., the Educoder community; Slotta & Aleahmad,2009), on the design, implementation, and deployment of location-tracking technologies in educational researchcontexts.Spatial mapping of inquiry discourse in the classroom through knowledgevisualizationCresencia Fong, Rebecca M. Cober, Tom Moher, and James D. SlottaTechnology has long been used to support online discussions (Coopey, Schneider, & Danahy, 2013; Peters &Hewitt, 2010; Dougiamas & Taylor, 2003; Linn & Hsi, 2000) and knowledge building (Scardamalia & Bereiter,1996), where it has served an important role in making student idea advancement dynamically and persistentlyvisible to peers, allowing for collaborative knowledge work on these ideas. However, such environments do notincorporate a phased inquiry discourse progression, and rely instead on the teacher’s intuitive sense of inquiryprogress. We continue to innovate on the development of Common Knowledge (CK) – a content-agnosticpedagogical and technological note-sharing application for collaborative inquiry. Through tight coupling of aninquiry script and a technology script, CK’s third iteration (CK3) scaffolded student knowledge communitiesthrough a student-driven phased inquiry progression. It also capitalized on the physical classroom layout as anadditional dimension of collaboration scripting and collective knowledge mapping.MethodWe engaged two classes of grade 5/6 students in a nine-week astronomy inquiry progression mediated by CK3.Using tablets, students contributed to a community knowledge base that was publicly visible on the “CommonBoard”, displayed on the classroom’s interactive whiteboard (IWB). This interactive display visualized thecommunity’s idea flow and enabled learners to sort their ideas by topic. CK3’s inquiry script scaffolded thecommunity through phases of science inquiry: Brainstorm, Investigate, and Propose. Students firstbrainstormed questions and theories, by using CK3 to contribute “Brainstorm” notes. They then proposedresearch trajectories and designed experiments to test their theories, by contributing “Proposal” notes.Contributions informed subsequent work in fluid interest-based groups (each group supported by a large-format“Topic Board” interactive display), in which students investigated the proposed research in a topic specialty oftheir choice, sharing findings via “Report” notes, and making inter-group connections. Throughout all inquiryphases, teachers and learners could manipulate visualizations of community ideas (i.e. CK notes) from the IWB,or from a group’s Topic Board (during Investigate phase only), clustering ideas by topic relatedness.OutcomesTeachers and students used the public displays (i.e., Common Board and Topic Boards) to gain a globalawareness of their community’s overall state of knowledge, including the relationship between notes andtags/topics (see Figure 3). While students could read and compose notes from their tablets, such knowledgerelatedness was not readily apparent on the tablet interface, which simply listed a note’s associated tags at theCSCL 2015 Proceedings634© ISLSend of the note, and included tag-based color-coding of Proposals. Furthermore, spatially distributing the TopicBoards in the classroom during the Investigative phase facilitated the formation of student-selected interestbased groups that focused students’ attention, while also spatially localizing the topics in the classroom. As ameans of facilitating inter-group knowledge exchange, students had the option of going on a “knowledge walk”to visit other groups during the Investigate phase, to speak with peers and read their notes.InvestigateFigure 3.

Middle:Common Board during the Propose phase; Proposals are visually connected and color-coded to align withcorresponding topics (tags were elevated to the status of “topics”). Right: Topic Board displays (each located atone interest group table) for all four interest groups in the class; all Proposals are visually linked tocorresponding Investigate Reports.Classroom observation data and student feedback indicated that such interest-based co-location enabledstudents with common inquiry interests to dialogue about their work and offered opportunities for collaborationon investigations. Furthermore, the Topic Boards served as a grounding reference for small-group interactionsabout the inquiry at hand.Teachers used students’ CK contributions that were visualized on the Common Board to spur oralclassroom discussions and guide inquiry. The public displays firmly maintained the goals of inquiry at theforeground; and the final Investigative phase spatially mapped topic specializations to distributed classroomlocations, thereby spatially distributing topic-based student collaborations. Thus, CK became a meditational toolbetween the two learning environments: (1) students’ collective inquiry performed in the digital note-sharingenvironment during student-directed small-group interactions, and (2) teacher-guided classroom discussions.Using maps to support investigations of animal behavior in our schoolyardRebecca M. Cober, Alisa Acosta, Tom Moher, and James D. SlottaScientific inquiry can take on many forms, including field investigations; through systematic collection ofevidence and communication of results, students can answer their own investigative questions (Windschitl et al.,2007). However, real world environments can be challenging for learners to work in because of their inherentcomplexity (Kamarainen et al., 2013). One means by which learners can organize and represent descriptiveresults is through maps, by indexing observed phenomena to physical locations within an environment ofinterest (Sobel, 1998). Maps can help learners to make sense of an environment, allowing them to explore data(e.g., analyze data and spot trends; Liben, 2001).MethodWe engaged one class (n=22) of Grade 5/6 students in Toronto, Canada in a six-week curricular unit of animalbehavior. The goal of the activity was to identify animal species that inhabited the schoolyard, and to understandtheir behaviors and interactions through the collection and interpretation of photographic evidence. Our interestwas to help students to work together as a scientific community and to enable students to create their own visualrepresentations of their results (Ainsworth et al., 2011). We supplied the class with 10 camera traps (i.e.,motion-activated cameras) for students to position strategically throughout their schoolyard (i.e., in locationsthat would likely yield photographs to address their inquiry questions). We provided the class with 10 laminated36 x 24 maps of their schoolyard and a toolkit to “mark up” the maps, consisting of tokens and stickers withicons (e.g., of animals) and dry-erase markers. In addition, we provided students with iPads (including camera)and a mobile application called Common Knowledge, to allow learners to contribute notes and photographs(e.g., camera trap photos and map photos) to a shared note-space (Figure 4).CSCL 2015 Proceedings635© ISLSFigure 4. Left: Camera trap and student placing a camera trap in the schoolyard; Middle: Planning map withstickers showing locations of animals sightings; Right: Student using iPad to share notes and photos with peers.What role(s) did maps serve in advancing students’ understanding of animal behavior in theirschoolyard?OutcomeMaps were used in three different activity structures throughout the unit: (1) In the initial phase of theunit, students cooperatively constructed aggregate representations of daytime/night-time animal behavior byplacing animal tokens on a group map. The tokens corresponded to locations where animals had triggered thecamera traps. A whole-class discussion concerning these aggregate maps served to orient students to i) thespecies that inhabit their schoolyard, ii) location-specific information about species (e.g., raccoons were sightednear garbage cans), and iii) basic temporal patterns of behaviour (e,g., some animals appeared in the daytimeonly). Students used findings from this preliminary activity to drive their subsequent inquiry questions andactivity (i.e., strategic camera trap placement). 2) Throughout all six weeks of the unit, students used iPadcameras to take photographs of maps that were annotated with tokens, markers, etc. and attached thesephotographs (n=39) to Common Knowledge notes. Maps were used both i) formatively and ii) summatively.Students used maps to plan investigations; for example, students placed camera trap tokens on their map toshow where they intended to place a camera, and the accompanying text of their planning note provided arationale for the placement. Students also used maps to summarize findings; for example, students annotatedtheir map with text and tokens to show results from previous camera trap placements (e.g., depicting a route thatraccoons take by synthesizing location-based sightings from multiple camera traps). 3) At the conclusion of theunit, student groups presented their “research stories” to their peers, using PowerPoint. Most of the studentgroups elected to include photographs of their maps in their presentations. The role of these maps was similar tothe role that they played in the second activity structure—to depict a plan for camera trap placement or to showa summary or synthesis of results.In interviews that were conducted at the conclusion of the unit, one student said that the maps gave him“a bird’s eye view [of the schoolyard], as opposed to walking through it.” Placing the tokens on the map enabledpatterns in the data to emerge; by “connecting the dots” he was able to establish a route that the raccoons took.Consideration of the physical environment when selecting and instrumentingsites for field investigationsAlexandra Silva, Chandan Dasgupta, Brenda López Silva, and Tom MoherField investigations conducted by scientists represent one method of inquiry used to build scientific knowledgethat can also be undertaken by students within the classroom (Windschitl et al., 2007). As with general scientificinquiries, field investigations require students to generate research questions, plan investigations, collect data,and report findings (Marx et al., 2004). When planning successful, real-world field investigations, scientistsconsider the physical environment of a potential field site to determine: 1) if it is amenable to investigation; and2) how it should be instrumented. The physical environment, or landscape, of an area is an especially importantconcern in the development of ecological field investigations (Turner, 2001).MethodThree classrooms of Grade 7 students in Chicago, IL participated in a seven-week instructional unit of animaldiversity and behavior. Students worked in small, autonomous groups within the context of the classroom’sscientific community to learn from and build upon each other’s work as they completed a series of scaffolded,CSCL 2015 Proceedings636© ISLSresearch-based activities. The unit culminated in a succession of autonomously-planned field investigations ofanimals at sites off school grounds. The five field sites across Chicago represented an extension of theclassroom, which learners accessed through landscape- and local-level images (Figure 5), but did not physicallyvisit. As part of the planning process, students selected which field site to investigate and determined how toinstrument the selected site with motion-activated camera cameras (i.e., placement and/or positioning of cameratraps). The camera traps produced photographic evidence of animals, which students then cataloged andanalyzed using a tablet-based application. A separate application, Common Knowledge, allowed students tocreate and share notes via a shared-note space. Groups produced a planning note for each investigationdescribing the motivation for selecting a given site and instructions of how we (i.e., researchers) shouldinstrument the site. Conclusions drawn from each investigation were shared within the classroom.Figure 5. Examples of images provided to students allowing access to the extended classroom. Left: Map ofavailable field sites distributed across Chicago; Middle: Landscape-level, aerial image of an individual field site;Right: Local-level, terrestrial image of a field site.To what extent did the physical characteristics of students’ extended classroom influence 1) thedecision of which field site to instrument and 2) the instrumentation of the field site?OutcomeWe coded and evaluated the planning notes from each field investigation and found that considerations of thephysical environment were incorporated into site selection and instrumentation in the majority of cases. Infifteen of twenty-five cases, students justified their site selections based on physical characteristics of theenvironment. Despite having access to landscape-level data of the entire extended classroom via an online mapapplication, landscape-level characteristics (i.e. physical composition or configuration on a scale greater than asingle site) were only considered in five cases. A comparatively greater number of site selections weremotivated by the local-level characteristics of a single site (e.g. presence of a body of water). In thirty-three ofthe forty plans to instrument field sites, learners explicitly considered some aspect of the physical environment.For example, one group opted to instrument a certain area within a field site “that's not on a trail… so peoplewon't scare the animals away.” These learners actively considered the absence of a trail and planned theircamera trap placement accordingly. In many cases, students considered the physical environment in conjunctionwith animal biology or behavior when deciding how to best instrument the field site (e.g., camera height mustallow for the capture of larger animals).The successful planning of real world field investigations requires serious consideration of the physicalenvironment’s composition and configuration. In many cases, the physical environment may be an underlyingmechanism influencing animal diversity or behavior, and thus essential to consider and understand. During theirfinal presentation, one group effectively alluded to this importance of landscapes within field investigations:“Certain animals like open areas for example, deer, while others like hidden areas like rats… One of ourdeployment places was Brookfield and we saw many deer there because there was an open space.”ReferencesAinsworth, S., Prain, V., & Tytler, R.
