Vocabulary growth was assessed basedon the student discourse in Knowledge Forum, an online community space designed tosupport Knowledge Building. Analysis of lexical proficiency based on Lexical FrequencyProfile and P_Lex indicated significant growth in productive written vocabulary, especiallyfor words beyond the first two 1,000 word lists. By tracing the growth of vocabulary extractedfrom specific word lists, we found that the growth rate for different types of words variedacross each year but correlated with each other. Correlation analyses between these lexicalmeasures and Knowledge Building behavioral indicators revealed that note revisions are thestrongest predictor of vocabulary growth rate, whereas note reading is related with lexicalproficiency measures.Keywords: Knowledge Building, literacy development, productive vocabulary, CSCLIntroductionLanguage acquisition is considered a major milestone in child development and plays a critical role in shapingthe child’s participation in everyday practices. For example, the child’s lexicon shares an interdependentrelationship with school learning and performance. Studies in the classroom have shown that word knowledgeplays a critical role in verbal and listening skills, reading comprehension, and learning of new concepts (e.g.,Biemiller, 2005; Cunningham & Stanovich, 1997; Stahl, 1991; Steahr, 2009). Additionally, the more words thestudent knows, the easier it is for them to access new resources and learn more (Stahl, 1991). Over the last fewdecades, a body of research in literacy education has been devoted to improving student learning and readingthrough explicit vocabulary instruction (for a review see Rupley, 2009). However, there is evidence that explicitvocabulary instruction leads to a decontextualized understanding of words. For example, teaching newvocabulary through dictionary definitions and spelling lists can lead to misuses of the true meaning of words;rather, learning new words through emergent use in authentic contexts can support a more holisticunderstanding of them (Miller & Gildea, 1987).Recognizing the limitations of explicit vocabulary instruction, developmental psychologists propose asocial-pragmatic view of language development (Akhtar & Tomasello, 2000), which argues that languageacquisition is driven by social interaction and the child’s need to connect with others. In other words, the child’slexicon is acquired through social experiences and conversational interactions wherein they are exposed tolanguage (Hoff, 2002). Words and sentences do not exist as islands by themselves; thus, explicit vocabularyinstruction that presents word definitions and exemplary sentences as self-contained “pieces” of knowledgewould not be sufficient (Brown, Collins, & Duguid, 1989). Sociocultural theorists further add that childdevelopment, which extends across social, conceptual, linguistic, and cultural competencies, must be understoodwithin the cultural context that the child develops (Vygotsky, 1978; Hedegaard, 2009). According to thisperspective, learning is a social and collaborative process, and classroom environments must support peer-topeer interaction (Hakkarainen, Paavola, Kangas, & Seitamaa-Hakkarainen, 2013). Integrated educationalcontexts for literacy allow students to participate in meaningful activities related to novel and challenging wordsthrough a variety of encounters and are effective for promoting depth of world knowledge, writing quality, andvocabulary expansion (Stahl, 1991). Benefits have been shown from the earliest grade levels of engagingstudents in authentic settings for vocabulary learning (e.g., Juel, 2006).Knowledge Building (KB; Scardamalia & Bereiter, 2006), a principle-based pedagogy that engagesstudents directly in sustained creative work with ideas, provides such a context for vocabulary development.Knowledge Building is “productive work that advances the frontiers of knowledge as these are perceived by acommunity” (Bereiter & Scardamalia, 2003, p. 1370). Knowledge Forum (KF)—technology designed to supportKnowledge Building—immerses students in literate environments extensible to the broader world on theInternet and beyond. It aims to optimize opportunities for knowledge creation, mirroring conditions of theCSCL 2015 Proceedings443© ISLSsurrounding open, innovation-driven, knowledge society—a complex world of ideas requiring that users createknowledge out of information fragments. In Knowledge Building classrooms, all students take collectiveresponsibility for generating and advancing ideas that “live in the world”—most immediately, the publiccommunity knowledge spaces of Knowledge Forum, where efforts to advance the frontiers of their communityknowledge require continuous reading, writing, and multimedia productions to contribute and improve ideas.Students read each other’s entries, search for information to answer questions, design and report experiments,and so forth. Conceptual advances are mirrored in vocabulary growth in online and offline exchanges betweenstudents, with vocabulary advances appearing as a by-product of their knowledge work (Sun, Zhang, &Scardamalia, 2008). The Knowledge Building proposition is that immersion in complex literate worlds fromearly ages of schooling will lead to advances in both basic and advanced competencies. This hypothesis hasbeen tested in previous studies, but within a shorter time frame (Resendes, Chen, Acosta, & Scardamalia, 2013;Sun, Zhang, & Scardamalia, 2008).Knowledge Building is compatible with the social-pragmatic and sociocultural perspectives on how thesocial environment plays a crucial role in facilitating the acquisition and productive use of new words. Thecurrent study aims to explore the phenomenon of vocabulary growth within a student cohort across theelementary years. Such longitudinal studies of the development of the productive vocabulary are almost nonexistent (Laufer, 1994), needless to say its scarcity in the Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL)context. Of equal importance is future work to connect vocabulary development and the advancement ofcommunity knowledge in CSCL, as well as to elicit lexical measures to assess productive work with ideas inCSCL. Our major research questions concerning the development of productive vocabulary in KnowledgeBuilding are:1. How did students’ lexical proficiency, as indicated by their written discourse in KF, change over thespan of six years?2. Did the rate of productive vocabulary growth remain consistent over time? Which words were usedmost frequently for each year?3. To what extent was productive vocabulary growth related to students’ Knowledge Buildingbehaviours?MethodsParticipants and the knowledge building contextThe participants were a student cohort of 22 students from the Dr. Jackman Institute of Child Studies (JICS) ofthe University of Toronto, where Knowledge Building pedagogy and technology has been used extensively forover a decade. Indeed, JICS has been highlighted as a school that continuously engages in Knowledge Buildingpractices, due to sustained collaborative efforts made by its teachers, principals, and students (Zhang, Hong,Scardamalia, Teo, & Morley, 2011). At JICS, Grades 1 to 4 are taught in separate classes, and Grades 5 to 6 aretaught in mixed classes. Each class is taught by one teacher, so students were taught by 5 different teachers intotal. The students started Grade 1 and finished Grade 6 at the same time; however, two students left the schoolbefore Grade 4 and five students left before Grade 5.Over the course of six years, students in the present study assumed collective cognitive responsibilityto improve their ideas (Scardamalia, 2002): They shared the consistent goal of advancing their collectiveunderstanding about authentic problems they cared about through face-to-face discussions and onlineinteractions in KF. They carried out explanation-seeking discourse propelled by their collective efforts toimprove their ideas through various means, such as observation, experimentation, and constructive use ofauthoritative sources. A detailed account of classroom dynamics is beyond the scope of this article, but can befound in the Knowledge Building literature (e.g., Scardamalia & Bereiter, 2006; Zhang, Scardamalia, Lamon,Messina, & Reeve, 2007). The student cohort in the present study examined topics in: science, such as“Butterflies,” “Invertebrates,” “Ecology,” “Rocks and Minerals,” and “Astronomy”; engineering, such as“Structures” and “Toys That Move”; and social science, such as “Medieval Times” and “Canadian Issues.”One important component of students’ Knowledge Building work was their extensive use ofKnowledge Forum (KF), an online community space for them to document ideas. Students wrote extensivelyabout their ideas, collectively making sense of difficult concepts, building coherent explanations, and carryingout “metadiscourse” (Resendes et al., 2013). While Knowledge Building discourse took place in multiple media,KF served as the central workspace for idea development. During face-to-face discussions, students wouldconstantly refer back to artifacts, such as texts, drawings, and videos in KF and would return to KF afterwards toCSCL 2015 Proceedings444© ISLSrevise their notes. As a result, reading and writing in KF is a meaningful literacy practice and an integral aspectof Knowledge Building (Sun, Zhang & Scardamalia, 2008).Data Sources and AnalysesThe primary data sources in the present study were KF log data produced by the participants over six years. Thedataset mainly included: (1) students’ KF notes, as well as their metadata, such as time, title, view, and authors;and (2) students’ activity log, which involved three types of actions—reading, creating, and modifying a note.To study the longitudinal development of students’ productive vocabulary, our analysis focused on aset of established lexical measures and their changes over time. KF notes were exported and grouped by schoolyear. The following lexical measures were computed for each unit of analysis (i.e., KF notes produced by eachstudent in each school year):(1) Lexical richness measures. We first counted the total word tokens and word types (i.e., unique words)produced by each student each year as two basic measures of lexical richness.(2) Lexical Frequency Profiles. Vocabulary proficiency can be measured in various ways. Lexicalfrequency profile (LFP) is a quantitative index proposed by Laufer and Nation (1995) to measure thevocabulary richness of a text based on its proportions of frequent versus infrequent vocabulary. Theunderlying assumption of LFP is that “a large number of infrequent words would make a text moredifficult to understand” (Laufer, 2013, p. 1). Based on this assumption, a student’s vocabularyproficiency can be inferred from the percentage of frequent and infrequent words they use in theirwritten text. LFPs were built for each student in each year, based on three word lists from a softwareprogram developed by Paul Nation: first 1000 word families, second 1000 word families, and theAcademic Word List (Coxhead, 2000). A student’s LFP was presented by percentages of words fromthese three word lists.(3) P_Lex. Recognizing LFP’s ineffectiveness with shorter text—text shorter than 200 words in particular(Laufer & Nation, 1995), Meara and Bell (2001) created another measure for vocabulary proficiency,P_Lex, which was claimed to work well for text as short as 90 words. This measure is based on thesame assumption as LFP, (i.e., the use of infrequent vocabulary indicates higher proficiency).However, P_Lex differs from LFP on how vocabulary proficiency is calculated and represented. Tocalculate P_Lex of a piece of text, we first divide the text into segments of 10 words. Then, for eachsegment, we count “infrequent” words beyond the first 1000 word families. For an imagined paragraphcontaining 108 words, we may get a vector: [0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0]. Then, we would feed the countsof each possible value (i.e., {0:4, 1:4, 2:2, 3:0, … 10:0}) into a Poisson distribution model. A λ(lambda) coefficient in the Poisson distribution model (ranging from 0 to about 4.5) is computed torepresent the lexical proficiency represented by the text, with a higher lambda score corresponding to ahigher proportion of infrequent words (for details see Meara & Bell, 2001).(4) Rate of vocabulary growth. Both LFP and P_Lex are solely concerned with the makeup of frequentversus infrequent vocabulary in texts and do not provide information about the growth of productivevocabulary size. Thus, for each student we also traced new vocabulary that appeared during each year.Using the same word lists as those used for LFP, we further distinguished frequent and infrequentvocabulary acquired by each student in each year. This analysis would help us pinpoint the wordsstudents acquired each year and the distribution of these words in different word lists.To determine whether there were changes within these lexical measures across the six years, MannKendall tests of trends and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was further conducted on eachmeasure. Meanwhile, to investigate the relationship between lexical development and Knowledge Buildingactivities, correlation analyses were conducted between the frequencies of Knowledge Forum behaviouralindicators, such as reading a note, creating a new note, and modifying an existing note, and the lexical measuresdescribe above. Additional correlation analyses were conducted among lexical measures for validity purposes.Finally, in order to uncover the context in which vocabulary learning occurs, we tracked a number of“difficult” words identified from students’ entries. Content analysis of related discourse was conducted to shedlight on the interpretation of aforementioned analyses.FindingsNote writing and reading across six yearsTable 1 shows the number of notes written, modified and read per student during six years. Over the six years,the average student created 88.67 notes, revised 63.43 notes, and read 601.48 notes, indicating substantialCSCL 2015 Proceedings445© ISLSliteracy practices in Knowledge Forum throughout the years. However, there were considerable variationsacross the years and among students, which were also found in previous studies (Sun, Zhang & Scardamalia,2008). At the class level, students were most active in Grade 3 and 4, while in Grade 6 their KF activitiesdropped to the lowest. This drop could be partially attributed to the increased adoption of other learningtechnologies when students entered higher grades, as reported by teachers. At the individual level, detailedanalysis uncovered substantive variations potentially linked to individual differences worth further investigation.Table 1.

Regardless of fluctuations across years, Mann-Kendall trend tests on both measures were significant(𝜏 = 0.18, p < .01 for both), indicating a trend of increase of produced tokens and unique tokens over the years.Table 2.

A Mann-Kendall test confirmed asignificant trend of increase, 𝜏 = 0.24, p < .001 (see Figure 1). Repeated measure ANOVA also revealedsignificant changes in P_Lex over the six years, F(5, 82) = 12.2, p < .001, 𝜂 2 = 0.42. However, it should benoted that P_Lex dropped in Grade 6, which corresponded to the drop of writing activities in Grade 6.While P_Lex provided a more robust measure of lexical profile in this specific context, lexicalfrequency profiles offered a more detailed depiction of the composition of vocabulary in student writing. Table3 reports the lexical frequency profiles of students across the six years. Trend analysis revealed a significantdecrease with the percentage of the first 1,000 words, 𝜏 = -0.24, p < .001, and a significant increase with thepercentage of words not in the lists, 𝜏 = 0.27, p < .0001. However, no trend was discerned from the percentagesof the second 1,000 words and the Academic words.Table 3.

We then traced each student’s acquisition of words in these four lists in each year. Aspresented in Figure 2, the growth of word types from these four lists of words were uneven. First of all, in eachyear most new words acquired by students were from the first 1,000 word list. Noticeably, the growth rate of theCSCL 2015 Proceedings446© ISLSfirst 1,000 words was consistent across years, whereas the Academic words and words out of the lists grew morerapidly in Grade 5 and 6. Mann-Kendall tests confirmed these trends—the first 1,000 words: 𝜏 = -0.16, p < .05;the Academic words: 𝜏 = 0.12, p = .08; words out of the lists: 𝜏 = 0.26, p < .001. No significant trend was foundwith the second 1,000 word list.Figure 1. Trend analysis of P_LexFigure 2. Growth of productive vocabulary over the six yearsRelationship between vocabulary growth and KB interactionsTable 4 presents the results of correlation analysis of lexical measures and Knowledge Building measures (i.e.,note reading, writing, and revisions). First of all, lexical proficiency measures (i.e., P_Lex and percentages offour different word categories) were not significantly correlated with the total numbers of word tokens and wordtypes, implying that the lexical proficiency measures we used were not significantly affected by the length ofstudent writing. Meanwhile, P_Lex was negatively correlated with the percentage of the first 1,000 words (r = .75, p < .001) and positively correlated with the percentages of words from the other three lists. These resultsconfirmed the validity of using these measures to assess lexical development of students in the present study.Second, the number of total word types was correlated with note writing (r = .29, p < .001) and noterevisions (r = .42, p < .001). In addition, the vocabulary size indicated in students’ six years of writing wasfound significantly correlated with all KB behaviours: reading (r = .55, p < .01), writing (r = .81, p < .001), andrevisions (r = .77, p < .001). These correlations indicated that students who write and read more in KnowledgeForum are likely to demonstrate greater growth in productive vocabulary. Interestingly, note modificationappeared to be the most significant predictor for vocabulary growth—more strongly correlated with the yearlygrowth rate of vocabulary (r = .35, p < .001) when compared with the other two KB measures. This findingrevealed a potentially fruitful linkage between idea improvement in Knowledge Building, indicated by noterevisions, and vocabulary development. Connecting with individual variations identified earlier, it would also beCSCL 2015 Proceedings447© ISLSworth further investigating whether there were any student-level background variables affecting bothKnowledge Building behaviour indicators and lexical measures.Finally, we found vocabulary growth in all four word categories positively correlated with each other,which suggests that basic and advanced vocabulary may have developed in tandem throughout the years,regardless their different growth rates in each year.Table 4.

Content analysis of student discourse identifiedplenty of such examples. In correspondence with one lower level of vocabulary learning, one cluster ofexamples could be best described as “definition seeking” discussion. For example,Student A:Student B:I need to understand: what is velocity?Speed.In this example, Student A might had incidentally heard the new word velocity, and the conversationbetween him and Student B focused on the definition of this new concept. Such definition-seeking conversationcan extend from one term to another, and could be fruitful for vocabulary learning. As another example,Student C:Student D:What is horizontally?Horizontally is sideways. Vertical is up and down.When Student D attempted to explain the definition of the adverb horizontally, they used the adjectiveform of its antonym. In this case, students were exposed to rich morphosyntactic environments for learning newwords and word families.In other cases, the definition of a word could not be easily attained; rather, meaning was achieved bypiecing together snippets of the definition contributed by more than one student. Take the followingconversation for example, neither Student F or G’s notes alone provides an accurate definition of claymore, buteach contains specific information about this vocabulary.Student E:Student F:Student G:What is a claymore? My theory is that it is a type of [pottery] wheel.I think a claymore was a type of big expensive sword that only the richestnobles or “earls” owned.My Theory [is] its a very big Scottish [sword].The second type of literacy practice could be characterised by “active use of vocabulary” with evolvingmeaning. In this case, students did not explicitly seek the definition of a word and were capable of using it inspecific contexts. However, by continually engaging with a concept, students were able to construct andreconstruct the scientific meaning of it over an extended period of time. One interesting example from thestudent discourse was the concept of “gravity.” In the Water Cycle unit during Grade 1, students mentioned therole of gravity in the formation of rain: “Then the water droplets make clouds and when the clouds get too heavywith water droplets it can't hold it any more so the gravity pulls all the water and it rains!” Another example:“My theory is that it's all about gravity. The groundwater stays down by gravity!” Then, in the engineering unitabout Flight, students were engaged with gravity from a different angle: “Because the plane is so big and heavyit is hard to reduce gravity because gravity can be taken away better if there are lighter, stronger materials.” Itwas not until the Astronomy unit in Grade 5/6 when students started to clearly articulate the concept of gravity:CSCL 2015 Proceedings448© ISLSStudent H:Student I:Student J:Student K:Student L:How does gravity work? Is it a force in the ground that pulls you down orsomething in the air that pushes you down?I think gravity comes from the core of the Earth or the core of other planets.How does gravity work in the middle of the earth?Gravity is: the downward pull of the earths gravitational field. The moregravity pulling an object the more the mass of the object is.I need to understand: first you say that you think that you would weigh moreon Jupiter because it has more gravity and then you say that you think thatyou would weigh less on Pluto because it's farther away from the sun. Arethese two different theories about how much you weigh on a planet?These conversations highlight students’ various conceptions of gravity, as well as the gradual conceptual changeunderlying their collective discourse. Over the course of six years, even though few explicit efforts were madeto define gravity, students were able to use this term in meaningful ways to support explanations in theirKnowledge Building work.In summary, as students progressed through the grades, they demonstrated considerable literacypractices in Knowledge Building through their reading, writing, and revision activities in KF. KnowledgeBuilding also enabled students to engage with vocabulary in sophisticated ways, representing different types ofliteracy practice. Connections between vocabulary knowledge and scientific understanding could be observed,which point to the notion of vocabulary knowledge—knowledge about word meanings—being a subset ofgeneral knowledge (Nagy & Herman, 1987, p. 28) and the richness of the Knowledge Building approachtowards literacy development.Conclusions and implicationsThis study explored the development of productive vocabulary in a group of Knowledge Building studentsacross the elementary school years. Results of lexical analysis indicated that students tended to produce moretokens, more unique word types, and text with an increasingly higher proportion of infrequent words with everyyear. In the absence of a control group, one may argue that this phenomenon simply reflects the naturalcognitive development of school children. However, correlation analyses between lexical measures andKnowledge Building behavioural indicators identified significant correlations between students’ productivevocabulary size and reading, writing, and revisions on Knowledge Forum. Moreover, note revisions emerged tobe the strongest predictor of the rate of vocabulary growth in each year. Further content analysis uncoveredinteresting moments when vocabulary learning happened naturally through Knowledge Building discourse.Overall, the present study highlights the potential benefits of Knowledge Building for vocabulary growth. Ourfindings support the socio-pragmatic and sociocultural notion that the acquisition of new vocabulary is moremeaningful in authentic social contexts, in our case, the KB classroom. When cognitive responsibility is handedover to students, not only do they willingly help one another in grappling with new vocabulary, they also do sosuccessfully. Instead of waiting for the teacher to provide them with a new vocabulary list, students sought outnew words to learn as they worked toward improving their community knowledge; students collectively ownedtheir vocabulary. In other words, vocabulary learning is an authentic and integrated practice of KB. Sustainedwork with ideas and knowledge advancement led to the progressive growth of the students’ collective lexicon.Of special interest to the authors is the potential of applying lexical indicators in the development offuture Knowledge Building analytics, so that individual and collective conceptual development could bedetected. Previous work has highlighted this link between literacy skill and knowledge advancement inKnowledge Building (Zhang & Sun, 2011). Future work should seek to model knowledge advancement in thecurrent dataset, as well as devise new analytic tools dedicated to literacy learning in Knowledge Building.ReferencesAkhtar, N., & Tomasello, M.
