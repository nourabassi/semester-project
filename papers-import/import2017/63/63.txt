Explanation-Giving in a Collaborative Tangible Tabletop Game:Initiation, Positionality, Valence, and Action-OrientationAlyssa Friend Wise, New York University, alyssa.wise@nyu.eduAlissa Nicole Antle and Jillian Warrenaantle@sfu.ca, jlw29@sfu.caSimon Fraser UniversityAbstract: Explanations given to each other by 20 pairs of 5 th grade children while playing atangible tabletop sustainability game were analyzed inductively for key themes relating totheir use of language, gesture and system tools. Half the pairs had been assigned roles (humandevelopment or natural resources manager) with associated system controls. Findings showedthat explanations by pairs in both conditions often employed collectivist language (“we”) inconjunction with positive reflections on the game-world state using the provided Impact Toolwhich gave feedback while system was paused. Pairs in the roles condition also gaveexplanations in response to partner actions and more frequently included negative and actionoriented prospective language about what should be changed moving forward. Roles pairsadditionally used questions to seek confirmation or action from their partner and madecomments from the perspective of the inhabitants of the fictional world. Implications for theresearch and design of collaborative tabletop learning systems are discussed.Keywords: Tangible systems, discourse, student roles, positive interdependenceCollaborative learning with interactive tabletops and tangiblesInteractive tabletops and tangibles are technologies that allow for physical interaction by users directly with thedigital surface (Higgins et al., 2011) and/or via digitally augmented objects that are recognized by the system(Ullmer & Ishii, 2000). They are particularly exciting for supporting face-to-face collaborative learning formultiple reasons (Fernaeus & Tholander, 2006; Dillenbourg & Evans, 2011; Speelpenning et al, 2011) such asthe ability to have multiple simultaneous users and create a shared transaction space for reference, negotiation,and action. Of particular interest in this work is the ability to facilitate joint attention through the visibility ofaction, the possibility to engage multiple modes of communication (e.g. speech, gesture, system action), and theopportunity to generate positive interdependence through the physical embodiment of distributed control.Despite these affordances, opportunities for collaboration aren’t always taken up by children. In addition to suchobvious problems as domination by one child, independent parallel play, and competition (Fleck et al., 2009;Marshall et al., 2009), children can also work together to complete tasks successfully but without deepengagement around the issues involved. For example, in our prior work studying children’s’ collaboration usinga tangible tabletop sustainability game, we found that pairs worked together for the entire duration of systemuse, but only talked in depth about their sustainability choices 5% of the time (Wise et al., 2015). For theremaining 95%, the children engaged in other forms of interaction in which they made game-based decisions,but without substantive explanation of their thinking. This mode of operation is parallel to quick consensusbuilding in the context of argumentation, in which learners are simply “accepting the contributions of thelearning partners in order to move on with the task” (Weinberger & Fischer, 2007, p. 77). This stands in contrastto richer forms of consensus building which are integration-oriented or conflict-oriented in nature. Fundamentalto both of these activities is the opportunity for students to experience a change in perspective based on hearingthe ideas and reasoning of their peers (Teasley, 1997). Thus getting children to share their thinking may havebenefits for reflective processes, collaboration, and learning (Price et al., 2003), and a greater understanding ofwhat leads children to explain their ideas in a tangible tabletop learning environment and the characteristics ofthis language that might lead to it be accepted by their partner is of central concern to the CSCL community.Giving explanations, positive interdependence and the Youtopia systemOne way to encourage children to share their thinking is by setting up a situation which requires theircomplementary participation for success. Tangible systems can be used to create such situations through thetechnological interdependence of different objects’ use (i.e. more than one input action must be takensequentially in order to create a successful system response) (Ullmer & Ishii, 2000; Antle, 2015). This can beCSCL 2017 Proceedings471© ISLSfurther layered with social interdependence in which the objects are assigned to children along with a set ofduties, rights and responsibilities (Wise et al., 2015). When multiple actions are needed to produce a certainoutcome and children require the assistance of their partner to enact these actions, it should encourage them toarticulate and explain their thinking to each other. Previously we have described a system designed to enactthese ideas: Youtopia is a tangible and multi-touch tabletop activity about sustainable land-use planning thatincludes co-dependent access points and the option to add scripted roles (with associated tools) to the existingcontingencies of tangible use (Antle et al., 2013; Fan et al., 2014). In a prior study we measured the degree ofexplanation-giving by 20 pairs of 5 th grade children using Youtopia in an authentic school environment with andwithout roles (Wise et al., 2015). Results showed pairs in the assigned roles/controls condition gave a greaternumber of explanations to their partners about what they wanted to do in the game. In this follow-up study weuse inductive qualitative methods to unpack this finding and probe the reasons why this occurred.MethodsResearch questionWhat kinds of talk, gesture and tool use characterize explanation-giving in pairs of children playing a tangibletabletop sustainability game with and without assigned roles/controls?Youtopia designYoutopia is a hybrid tangible and multi-touch tabletop application about sustainable land-use planning in whichchildren have the opportunity to design their own world, exploring how different land-use decisions affect theamount of food, housing and energy provided to the population, and the impact these decisions have on the levelof pollution in the environment. Following the principles of Emergent Design (Antle et al., 2014), ourinteraction goals were for children to explore the relationships between different land-use decisions, see theireffects on the world, discuss with their partner the inherent tradeoffs between meeting human needs and causingpollution, and through this make informed decisions to create a world they would want to live in. Children beginwith an undeveloped map of mountains, grasslands, forest and a river. They interact with the tabletop throughtwo kinds of physical stamps that designate different land-use types (see Figure 1a): natural resource stamps(tree icon); and human development stamps (wrench icon) [see Table 1]. Each stamp also has a picture and alabel describing the land-use type, and color is used to indicate land-uses that relate to the same human need.Figure 1. (a) Stamping a land-use (b) Assessing world-state from Impact Tool (c) Attempting to erase a landuse.Land-use types have predefined relationships to each other and to the terrain designed to reflect real worldrelations (see Table 1). For example, a farm can only be built on grasslands and requires irrigation connecting itto the river. Thus, while each stamp is used individually, system interdependencies require multiple stamps to beused together to build the Youtopia world. Children can learn about these relationships and their effects on theworld through trial and error with educative error explanation tabs, using the open circular tangible “info ring,”and by assessing the state of the world with the Impact Tool that provides visual information about pollutionlevels and the proportion of the population that has shelter, food and energy (see Figure 1b). The Impact Toolfreezes the map (so no other interactions with the system can take place while it is in use) and includes adiagnostic touch functionality: children can touch any of the four rings indicating levels of food, shelter, housingand pollution to highlight the elements in the world contributing to it. The Impact Tool also contains an imageof a pig that asks children “Is this a world you want to live in?” with the goal of eliciting a discussion oftradeoffs. An Eraser Tool (see Figure 1c) is available to remove land uses children want to eliminate or replacewithout penalty, allowing for experimentation and incremental building. A full description of the system designis given in Antle et al. (2013) and a short video of functionality is available at tinyurl.com/youtopiagameplay.CSCL 2017 Proceedings472© ISLSTable 1: Types of Youtopia Land-use StampsArea of Human NeedFood (green labels)Shelter (pink labels)Energy (yellow labels)*Natural Resource Stamps (tree)Garden, FarmHarvest LumberCoal MineEnvironment (orange labels)**Forest, River & MountainReservesHuman Development Stamps (wrench)Irrigation***Houses, Town Houses, ApartmentsCoal PlantHydro Plant***Arrows indicate land-uses required for other land-uses. * Energy land-uses increase pollution. ** Environment land-usesreduce pollution *** Irrigation and hydro plants use-up river water; this is reflected in a visual display of the water levelYoutopia useForty 5th grade children (ages 10-11, 18 boys / 22 girls) from two classrooms used Youtopia in pairs (N=20). Allchildren had extensive experience collaborating and participated in a class unit on sustainability issues fourmonths earlier. Use of Youtopia was introduced as a review of the sustainability unit in which children wouldget to spend up to 25 minutes building a world they wanted to live in to share with the class. Half of the pairswere randomly chosen to be given assigned roles/controls with role types balanced across gender in the overallsample. For these pairs, one child was randomly assigned to be the “natural resource manager” with all the“tree” stamps (lumber; garden; farm; coal mine; nature, river, mountain reserves) placed in front of them on oneside of the table; the other child was randomly assigned to be the “human development manager” with all the“wrench” stamps (irrigation; (town)house; apartment; coal plant; hydro dam) placed in front of them on theother side of the table. Use of assigned tools was not explicitly enforced; the design relied on social normsaround ownership of items on tables (e.g. you use the cutlery placed in front of you) and the explicit labeling ofthe tools with the wrench/tree icons that identified them as associated with a particular role. Tools not associatedwith a role (Impact Tool; info ring; eraser) were placed at the end of table between the children. For pairs whowere not given assigned roles/controls, all of the stamps were placed at the end of table between the children.Data collection and explanation identificationVideos of all twenty pairs’ sessions were collected. Youtopia use (using one of two identical installations) wasconducted in separate rooms apart from the classroom to minimize distraction and extraneous noise. A highdefinition digital video camera captured a landscape view of the children and oblique view of the tabletop.One (roles) pair’s data was removed from analysis as an outlier due to a lack of substantial talk or engagementthroughout the session. Time-periods in which children explained their thinking or reasoning related to decisionsabout what resources and developments to use were identified in the remaining video data. For example “Let’sbuild houses, not apartments-they use less lumber so we can make more nature reserves” would be coded as anexplanation but “I think we should have houses not trees” would not. Three researchers achieved acceptableinter-rater reliability (κ >.63) with all differences reconciled. A total of 58 explanations were identified acrossthe 10 non-roles pairs while 80 explanations were found for the 9 roles pairs.AnalysisData analysis was conducted inductively following the constant comparative method (Gibson & Brown, 2009)with particular attention to the concerns of video-based data (Derry et al., 2010).Phase 1: TranscriptionAll 138 explanations were transcribed into a text file. With the goal of understanding collaborative processes,the time-span of an explanation included events that led up to the explanation as well as any response orreaction expressed by the partner. Transcripts thus captured (a) all verbalizations during the coded time periodand two to four related turns of talk before and after; (b) indication of the physical actions taking place during /between turns of talk including (i) body position, (ii) tool use, (iii) gestures, (iv) facial expressions, and (v) childlocation around the table. In addition, the transcriber provided a global overview of each event that indicatedwhat aspect of the Youtopia world the explanation was about, what occurred leading up to the comment, andany response or reaction expressed by the partner. An example for one explanation is shown in Figure 2.Phase 2: Open and confirmatory coding of non-roles explanation transcriptsThree researchers individually read all the transcripts for the non-roles pairs and using constant comparisongenerated a list of potential themes seen in the data. The goal at this stage was to be as inclusive as possible inCSCL 2017 Proceedings473© ISLSretaining themes. The researchers then shared and discussed proto-themes, condensing and combining similarideas to create a master list of 11 possible themes. Each potential theme was then subject to individual scrutinywith a search through the transcripts for confirming or disconfirming evidence. Each of the three researcherstook primary responsibility for a theme, but work was conducted collaboratively with extensive consultation.Importantly, attention was paid not only to how frequently evidence of a theme was found across the wholecorpus, but also its existence across multiple episodes and groups. In this round of coding, two similar themesrelating to use of the Impact Tool and the initiation of explanations were combined and two related to theexpression of emotion were dropped due to lack of evidence. This left a total of 8 themes.C1 (f)Human Devel.C2 (m)Natural Resour.XXXXAnd then what should we do?

In the open coding, 4 additional potential themes were identified. Thus, a total of 12 possible themeswere examined in the confirmatory coding. As the data was examined, two of the newly identified potentialthemes were incorporated into an existing theme due to similarity in content, and one theme related to the use ofthe Eraser Tool was dropped due a lack of evidence. In addition, the final new theme and three existing themeswhich all related to aspects of articulation of arguments and tradeoffs were combined into a single theme. Theexisting themes whose scope was altered or expanded during analysis of the roles condition were taken back forfollow-up examination with the non-role pairs’ transcripts. This resulted in a total of 6 themes relating toexplanation-giving whose presence or absence and characterization are reported across roles and non-roles pairs.FindingsThe six themes described below speak to how explanation-giving was initiated as well as the perspectives theexplanations represented and the temporality, valence and positionality expressed within them.Theme 1: World-state- versus partner-initiated commentsExplanation-giving often occurred as a response to the world-state; in the roles condition explanationsalso commonly occurred in response to a partner action or commentIn Non-Roles pairs, explanations were most often made in response to the state of the world. This wascommonly prompted by use of the Impact Tool which provided feedback on pollution levels and the meeting ofhuman needs (e.g. “So how are we turning out? [puts Impact Tool on screen] Food is pretty good. I think it isreally good because there is no pollution.” C1 in N8@15:58). Children also gave explanations of their thinkingabout the world state as depicted on the map (e.g. “I don’t like how we took up all the trees but [rubs hands onface]…like…I think it’s good.” C1 in N1@18:03). In a more limited number of cases, non-roles children gaveexplanations in response to something said or done by their partner (e.g. “But we don't want to put it near amountain, it will kill the goats and stuff. That's sad.” C1 in N9@11:42 responding to their partner’s suggestionabout where to put a coal plant). In Roles pairs the same kinds of situations initiated explanations with onenotable difference: there were a substantial number of both world-state and partner-initiated explanations. Inmany cases these explanations appeared to be related to stamp ownership by the two roles (e.g. “Yea, becausethen most people will have food.” C2 in R6@18:54 responding to their partner, who had the garden stamp buthad not yet used it, making a hesitating statement that only “maybe” stamping it was a good idea). Similarinitiation of explanations occurred even when the action in question would be taken with the Eraser Tool whichboth children had access to. This indicates a tacit acknowledgement of the ownership of decisions related toparticular land use types in roles pairs (e.g. “These ones? [motioning to some apartments on the map] maybe we*should* lose some apartments. They’re too cramped up in that area.” C2 in R5@16:19, who was responsiblefor human development, responding to their partner’s idea that they should remove some of the apartments).CSCL 2017 Proceedings474© ISLSTheme 2: Retrospective versus prospective temporalityMost explanations were retrospective reflections on the state of the world, but in the roles conditionthere were also action-oriented prospective explanations about what should be done to change itExplanations in Non-Roles pairs were mostly retrospective reflections on the existing state of the world (e.g.“Wait, if you look at our pollution. See now our pollution is fine.” C1 in N3@18:55). At times these alsoincluded a call to action about what should be done (e.g. “There’s little pollution! We’re in the good zone! Let’sjust put one more.” C2 in N6@16:28). In addition, there were a small number of statements of a timeless naturedescribing what children valued in the world (e.g. “There should be at least many [people who have food].” C2in N2@8:57) and ones which described an anticipated future (e.g. “Yeah, it will be nice to have some animals.”C2 in N6@3:21). In Roles pairs the temporality of explanations distributed into the same four categories;however, there was a much greater presence of prospective calls-to-action about what should be done. Theseoccurred both in combination with reflections on the existing state (as was seen for non-roles pairs, e.g. “Ohman, a lot of the water’s gone [looking at the brown river], do you think we need to kill the hydro dam? C1 inR8@12:56”) but also on their own as stand-alone comments (which was seen less frequently non-roles pairs,e.g. “I don’t know about using coal because we don’t want to make it too polluted.” C2 in R3@10:20).Theme 3: Collectivist versus partner-directed languageThere was a strong use of collectivist language (“we”) in both conditions; in the roles conditionlanguage referring to the learning partner (“you”) was also commonly seenWithin Non-Roles pairs there was a much greater use of first person plural language (e.g. “Okay so that meanswe need [to use] more trees which is kind of sad.” C1 in N1@3:30) than first person singular (e.g. “I think it isreally good because there is no pollution.” C1 in N8@13:05). When employed, use of the first person singularwas almost always followed by an opinion verb such as think or feel (as in the example above) and often alsoconnected with a reference to the collective (e.g. “I feel like we’re using up too much of the trees.” C2 inN4@9:55). A similar pattern was seen for Roles pairs with the addition of a greater use of the second personsingular (“you”) in combination with a reference to the collective (e.g. “Do you want to try another irrigation toget more food ‘cause that’s the only way big problem we have?” C2 in R1@25:00).Theme 4: Positive versus negative languageNon-roles pairs primarily used positive language in giving explanations while roles-pairs also usednegative language to oppose things their partner had said or done, and used questions to seekconfirmation, agreement or action from their partnerChildren in Non-Roles pairs gave explanations largely using positive terms. Typically a child made a statementabout the state of the world, followed by a positive comment (e.g. “Only a little [pollution]. That’s good.” C2 inN4@4:54). Other positive statements referred to the state of the world directly (e.g. “We have a pretty darngood world here.” C2 in N6@17:10). Non-roles children less frequently used negative terms in theirexplanations or opposed something their partner had said. When they did, these tended to be tied to actionoriented phrases about what should be changed (e.g. “There’s not enough water though, maybe we need to erasethe fish.” C1 in N5@11:53). In contrast, children in Roles pairs expressed their explanations using a variety ofneutral, positive and negative statements as well as questions. Notably, there were many more explanations inthat had a negative valence; children often offered an explanation as they opposed something their partner hadjust said or done (e.g. “But this like pollutes though, remember?” C2 in R2@12:43 responding to their partnerstamping a coal plant on the map). Often these opposing statements involved negative terms and/or suggestedundoing what the other learner had just done (e.g. “Maybe, ugh … Water brown?”[erases the irrigation theyhave just stamped in response to their partner’s suggestion that they build more gardens and a farm] “I don’twant to do that ‘cause then the fish don’t have much water.” C2 in R5 15:02). Opposition was also enacted attimes in the form of a question which opened up a space for the partner to share their thoughts in response to thedifference in opinion (e.g. “Why is the garden so far from the houses?” C2 in R2@3:14 in response to C1placing an apartment stamp).” Directing questions to the learner partner was also a frequently occurrence inroles pairs’ explanations, even when opposition was not present. For example children often soughtconfirmation, agreement or action from their partner either directly (e.g. [placing Impact Tool] “Not everyonehas shelter…Do you want to take out some parks?” C1 in R8@8:48 [C2 who is responsible for natural resourcesresponds by erasing three nature reserves]) or indirectly (e.g. “Energy would be coal plant and hydro dam[points at both stamps which belong to their human developer role]. Both cause pollution. This is less [waveshand above hydro stamp]. Maybe hydro dam? Where can it fit?” C1 in R9@18:59).CSCL 2017 Proceedings475© ISLSTheme 5: Holistic versus positioned perspectiveChildren in non-roles pairs gave explanations when the environment was healthy or human needswere met, often shifting to focus on the balance between these towards the end of a session; incontrast children in roles pairs gave explanations when pollution was high or human needs were notmet and many of the pairs aligned their comments with their roles for the majority of the session.Children in Non-Roles pairs gave explanations about three main aspects of the Youtopia world. First, when theenvironment was relatively healthy (e.g. “Okay there’s little pollution. That’s way better.” C2 in N1@7:25).Second, when human needs were met (e.g. “Oh wow… [pointing to full shelter indicator on impact display]…that’s good!” C1 in N7@8:14). Third, about the balance or trade-offs balance between a healthy state of theenvironment and human needs being met (e.g. “Well I want everyone to have energy but then we might havemore pollution.” C2 in N2@16:42). More often than not, these comments were positive in nature as noted in theprevious theme (e.g. [looking at impact display rings] “There’s lots of pollution but everyone has energy now.”C1 in N3 @23:06) though at times children also recognized the difficulty of the choices that needed to be made(e.g. “This is really hard trying to keep the water full and having stuff as well.” C1 in N10@13:06). In somenon-roles pairs children talked about trade-offs and advocated for a balanced world from the beginning;however in others they initially advocated for either people’s needs or the environment, only shifting to considerbalance later in the session (e.g. “I want everyone to have energy.” C2 in N2@16:45 versus “All I wanna do isadd more energy but then that’s gonna add more pollution.” C2 in N2@20:08). In contrast, children in five ofthe Roles pairs advocated according to their assigned role for most of the session. As described in the two priorthemes, these explanations were often phrased in the negative and oriented towards taking action. For example,the natural resources manager gave explanations when pollution was high or water levels were low (e.g. “Oh nono no no, we don't need that happening [erases irrigation] we need to preserve some water [tries a river reserve,water turns brown again, erases it the reserve] that's not good.” C2 in R5@15:31) while the humandevelopment manager gave explanations when human needs were not met (e.g. [looking at Impact Tool] “Noteveryone has shelter…do you want to take out some parks?” C1 in R8@18:54). In the other four pairs, childrengave explanations that were both aligned and in contrast with their assigned role. Near the end of their session,they shifted away from the roles to address questions of balance, making comments that showed a recognition ofthe trade-offs involved (e.g. “Now there’s a little pollution but I think we’re almost at full energy.” C2 [naturalresource manager] in R7@16:14).Theme 6: Connected versus detached languageChildren in roles pairs gave explanations that included the perspectives of the world’s inhabitantsAn additional theme found in the examination of explanations in Roles pairs was comments about theexperiences or feelings of the inhabitants of the world. There were a substantial number of these statementsrelating to a variety of things such as: living conditions (e.g. [smiles] “Oh, they’re neighbors.” C1 in R5@5:17);the availability and proximity to food (e.g. “But should we do like houses around the garden? So they stay alivewith food and stuff…” C2 In R2@4:28); the impact of pollution (e.g. “Do you want to put this over there sothese people don’t have like the pollution from that?” C1 in R1@20:51); and lifestyle concerns (e.g. “I think weshould make a few because people like nature reserves don’t they…” C1 in R7@5:08). What the comments allhad in common was thinking about or from the perspective of the people living inside of the system. Suchcomments were seen much less frequently in the Non-Roles condition where the vast majority of explanationstook a detached “gods-eye” view (e.g. “Okay there’s little pollution. That’s way better.” C2 in N1@7:23).DiscussionExplanations and interdependent roles/controlsThe impact of positive interdependence induced via assigned roles with associated controls on explanationgiving was the core focus of this research. Prior work had found that the overall amount of explanation-givingwas increased by this strategy (Wise et al., 2015). The present finding that, for roles pairs only, a substantialportion of explanations were given in response to a comment or action made by their partner, begins to offersome insight into why. Roles pairs asked questions of their partner to seek confirmation, opposed things theirpartner had said or done, and used “you” language to request (or direct) their partner to take a particular action.These behaviors appear to stem directly from the distributed ownership and interdependence of the systemcontrols. For example, opposition was stimulated by the fact that actions taken by one child always hadimplications for the other (Antle, 2015). Similarly, questions or requests for action were necessitated by the factthat providing for human needs (food, shelter, energy) required using at least one stamp assigned to eachCSCL 2017 Proceedings476© ISLSpartner. Notably, while use of assigned tools was not enforced, no violations of the assignment occurred.Drawing on Rick et al.’s (2009) finding that children took more responsibility for the parts of the tabletopsurface closer to their relative position, this may be in part due to the initial presentation of role stamps onopposite sides of the table. These norms of social ownership (Speelpenning et al, 2011) related to land-use werestrong as they even extended to use of the shared Eraser Tool to remove elements associated with each role.The extent to which the different character (and additional quantity) of roles pairs explanations hasimplications for the children being open to, or actually changing, their ideas is an important areas for futureresearch. Children’s efforts to seek confirmation or agreement from their partner about what to do in the gamesuggest some attempt towards the desired end of thinking beyond their own personal views (Teasley, 1997).This is also supported by the finding of comments considering the welfare of the world inhabitants by rolespairs. In addition, oppositional explanations are potentially valuable for stimulating learning since they push thechildren to reconsider their ideas about what an ideal world looks like in ways that positive evaluations do not(Weinberger & Fischer, 2007). Conversely, many children in the roles pairs stayed on “their” side of the issues(human needs or the environment) for the majority of the session, rather than progressing to a more balancedposition acknowledging the tradeoffs between them. This suggests a design strategy first promoting anoppositional stance and then later switching to a togetherness stance. One approach to this could be via gamephases where roles/controls are scripted/assigned at the beginning but deliberately released partway through.Explanations and the impact toolAcross all pairs, the Impact Tool was commonly used in conjunction with explanation-giving. There are severaldesign features that may have contributed to this. First, use of the Impact Tool paused interaction in the game.The ensuing talk during these pauses suggests the effectiveness of Antle’s (2015) recommendations to helpchildren “step-out” of the tangibles action and create space for them to explain their thinking. Second, the toolbrought up a status screen that provided feedback on the world-state (levels food, energy, shelter and pollution)and was jointly available to both children with a prompting question (“Is this a world you want to live in?”).Previously we found that to be shared by group members, tabletop elements must be readable and reachablefrom multiple sides of the table (Antle et al., 2011). This appeared to be effective here in eliciting children toshare their evaluations of the world and the reasons for them with each other. The visualization providing thisfeedback was intentionally value-neutral (see Emergent Design Principles, Antle et al., 2014): the pig’s speechbubble asked “Is this a world you want to live in?” and the circular scales for pollution, shelter, food, energycould be viewed from either a “half-full” or “half-empty” perspective. While non-roles roles pairs tended to usethis referential anchor to comment on what was (already) good in the world, roles pairs also used it to point outcould be better. The root cause of this difference is not clear, but it is potentially related to a greater feeling ofresponsibility for the world imparted with the assignment of roles (Wise et al., 2012). There is evidence for thisin the connected language used by roles pairs to talk about the experiences of people in the world (rather thanthe detached language used by non-roles pairs). Whether a heightened sense of responsibility and forwardoriented talk is advantageous for learning remains to be examined; we suspect there may be benefits forcognitive engagement from children feeling accountable for their activity and actively comparing the worldstate with the one they would like to build, rather than simply admiring the current one (Chi & Menekse, 2015).This can be tested empirically with designs that intentionally lead children to take one perspective or the other(for example the pig could ask different questions: “What is good about this world?” versus “What can makethis world better?”) and evaluate the resultant talk and learning. The optimal situation may involve fluid flowbetween the two perspectives; this could be encouraged in various ways (e.g. the system rotates betweendifferent prompts or prompts whichever perspective is less represented). A third feature of the Impact Tool thatmay have been important specifically for roles pairs was the diagnostic touch functionality that showed theelements contributing to world’s food, shelter, housing and pollution. This functionality was often used toidentify and explain the causes of a dissatisfying situation leading to a suggestion for change. The presence of anEraser Tool that allowed children to endlessly undo and redo actions also may have played an enabling role insupporting cycles of experimentation, evaluation, and change (Fleck et al., 2009). This follows Antle’s et al.(2014) recommendation of multiple, bidirectional pathways through activities as a way to encourage emergentdialogue and the exploration of values. The proposition that diagnostic and undo functionalities play a role insupporting explanation-giving (when a prospective view is taken) can be tested via comparisons of children’ssystem use with and without the relevant features available.Conclusions and future workThis study investigated the character and differences in explanation-giving by pairs of children playing atangible tabletop sustainability game with and without assigned roles/controls. Findings showed an importantCSCL 2017 Proceedings477© ISLSrole of the Impact Tool in provoking explanations related to its pausing, feedback and diagnostic features. Theinterdependency created in roles pairs led to greater opposition and question-asking as part of explanations.Improvement-oriented explanations that included references to Youtopia inhabitants’ experience may be due toan increased sense of responsibility to the game-world. Enduring positionality among roles pairs needs to beaddressed with future design iterations. An additional area for future inquiry is the use of the specific linguisticfeatures identified as proxies to semi-automate the characterization of explanation-giving.AcknowledgementsWe gratefully acknowledge funding from NSERC, SSHRC, and the GRAND NCE and wish to thank the grade5 students and teachers we worked with at Stratford Hall Independent School.ReferencesAntle, A.N.
