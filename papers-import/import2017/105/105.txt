To uncoverthe degree of asymmetric collaboration, the social entropy index (the sum of relativeparticipation proportions of each individual) was adopted in some studies, but only quantitativeindicators (e.g., the number of characters) were considered in the measurement. In this study,we define participation evenness plus the dimension of the quality of students’ notes as “ideaevenness”. Adopting the entropy and using the depth of understanding within students’theorizing notes as the parameter, we analyzed the idea evenness of five Knowledge Buildingcommunities. We found that the idea evenness values are high in four of the communities andcan reflect the different distributions of students’ depth of understanding in differentcommunities. The results indicate that students participated in theorizing evenly in mostknowledge building communities.IntroductionKnowledge Building aims to facilitate students to work on real ideas and address their authentic problems bytaking collective responsibility (Scardamalia, 2002). By joining efforts, people may achieve something new thatcould only emerge as a result of their interactions (Broadbent & Gallotti, 2015). Therefore, ensuring anenvironment for these interactions to happen is of vital importance. One of the negative factors that may harmstudents’ interactions is participation inequality, which refers to the phenomenon that a tiny minority of usersaccounts for a disproportionately large amount of community content and other activities (Nielsen, 2006). Forexample, the “free rider” phenomenon (Burdett, 2003) and the perception of an asymmetric collaboration amongteammates (Capdeferro & Romero, 2012) were identified as frustrating things by the students who participate inonline Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL). Egalitarian collaborative systems are the preferredfuture organizational form (Brafman & Beckstrom, 2006). In line with the Knowledge Building goal of re-creatingschools as knowledge creating organizations, symmetric knowledge advancement is highlighted in KnowledgeBuilding (Scardamalia, 2002).Therefore, it is of great importance to study and measure with appropriate methodologies the mannerthat students distribute contributions, the extent to which uneven contributions occur in online collaboration, andfurthermore, how uneven contributions may influence students’ knowledge building. The social entropy index hasbeen proposed as a possible approach for understanding system-level evenness (e.g., Bruno, 2010; Matei et al,2006; Matei, et al., 2015). Mathematically, the normalized social entropy index is the sum of relative participationproportions of each individual divided by the log of the total number of people. It was derived from Shannon’sTheory of Communication (Shannon & Weaver, 1998). The idea is that in the realm of communication all symbolsare equally likely to occur if they are only decided by chance, just as all atoms are likely to be in a random statein physical systems (Shannon & Weaver, 1998). The opposite is that the more organized the system is, the lowerthe entropy will be. Matei et al. (2010) proposed that human affairs can be understood as atoms or symbols, andindividual’s contributions would not be greater than chance can predict in a purely random and unstructured state.In this situation, the social entropy of this group is maximized. However, when a group is structured (i.e. whenmembers take on some specific tasks, interact with others in a preferential manner, or contribute more or less thanchance can predict), the social entropy starts to decrease. Bruno (2010) measured the participation evenness of 25wiki groups, and the number of characters that students contributed were utilized as the parameter. He found thatthere is a curvilinear relationship between participation evenness and learning outcomes, and an optimal level ofevenness which was close to the high spectrum exists (see figure 4 in Bruno, 2010, p109). Adjusting the entropyto the scale of 0 to 1, it seems the optimal level ranges from 0.85 to 0.95. The results may somehow imply theoptimal level evenness of knowledge building community although the study was not directly conducted inknowledge building communities.Although the quality of students’ contributions plays a significant role in a community, it is notconsidered in the evenness measurement (Biuk, Kelen, & Venkatesan, 2008). In this study, we added theCSCL 2017 Proceedings668© ISLSdimension of the quality of students’ ideas to the participation evenness and define the variable as “idea evenness”– the sum of individual’s relative apportionment of ideas (both quantity and quality) divided by the log of the totalnumber of people.In this exploratory study, we aim to investigate the value of idea evenness in five cases of KnowledgeBuilding communities to see how idea evenness reflects the distribution of students’ contribution in communitylevel. This study may serve as an initial attempt to understand idea distribution in a community level and to helpreveal the relationship between idea evenness and learning performance. In order to evaluate the quality ofstudents’ contributions, we employed the “epistemic complexity” and the “scientific sophistication” measures,proposed by Zhang, Scardamalia, Reeve, and Messina (2009). The epistemic complexity of ideas indicatesstudents’ efforts to produce theoretical explanations and elaborations of phenomena and the ideas that theircommunity works on. The scientific sophistication dimension assesses to what extent students move from anintuitive to a scientific understanding.Methods and data analysisSecondary data analysis consisted of 1209 notes posted in Knowledge Forum – an online environment supportingKnowledge Building (Scardamalia, 2004). The notes were written by Grade 1 to Grade 5/6 (blended grades)students at a Knowledge Building school in downtown Toronto. In each grade, one class with about 20 studentswas included in this analysis. Each class worked in a communal Knowledge Forum space which was consideredas an online community.Primary analysis on this dataset was conducted by Resendes (2013) and her colleague using the “waysof contributing” framework (Chuy et al., 2011) which consists of six dimensions and 24 sub-dimensions. The sixdimensions are: questioning, theorizing, obtaining information, working with information, synthesizing andmaking analogies, and supporting discussion. A note might fall into several dimensions that are applicable.Theorizing plays an important role in knowledge advancement (Chen, Resendes, Chai, & Hong, in press) forexhibiting students’ attempts to produce original ideas, to produce and improve explanations, and to expressalternative directions (Resendes, Chen, Acosta, & Scardamalia, 2013), and for underscoring students’ pursuit toconstruct new knowledge (Carey & Smith, 1993). Therefore, in this study we will focus only on theorizing (i.e.proposing an explanation, supporting an explanation, improving an explanation and seeking an alternativeexplanation) notes. All the theorizing notes were coded using epistemic complexity scale (1 = unelaborated facts,2 = elaborated facts, 3 = unelaborated explanations, and 4 = elaborated explanations) and scientific sophisticationscale (1=pre-scientific, 2 =hybrid, 3 = basically scientific, and 4 = scientific). The overall agreement was 81.65%for epistemic complexity and 82% for scientific sophistication. With regard to a note, a composite score bymultiplying the epistemic complexity score and the scientific sophistication score was considered as its depth ofunderstanding (Zhang et al., 2009). For each student, the composite scores of his/her notes were added up, andthe total score was used as the parameter to calculate the idea evenness of this community.Using each student’s share of depth of understanding, idea evenness was calculated using the normalizedsocial entropy formula in each class separately. To better understand the essence of the social entropy indexconcept, we would paraphrase how Matei et al. (2010) discussed it in computer-mediated collaborationenvironment:Suppose in an online community space (M), there are m students who contribute n notes in total (a noteonly belongs to a student). Let C be a set of each student’s notes.M = {M1, M2, …Mn}, C = {C1, C2, …Cm}, then C=MSi the ith student’s share (mathematical proportion) of notes in the note space M.𝑚𝑚𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 = 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 ⁄∑𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗=1 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 ∑𝑖𝑖=1 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 = 1If we have only one participant in M, then there is no uncertainty of who posted the notes. But if we havetwo, a degree of uncertainty of contribution happens. For the perspective of information theory (Shannon &Weaver, 1998), there are two possible answers to the question of who posted a note, which carry 1 bit (log22) ofinformation. If we have m participants, the answer to the above question will have m possibilities, which carrylog2m bit of information.Mathematically, the social entropy of a random variable X is defined as:𝐻𝐻 (𝑋𝑋) = − ∑𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖=1 𝑝𝑝(𝑥𝑥 ) log 2 𝑝𝑝(𝑥𝑥) where p(x) represents the share of each student’s contributionsMore participants indicate more diverse participation, the more distributed of the contributions by thestudents, and the higher social entropy, which may even hide the “lurker” problem. For example, the social entropyfor a community with two students who contribute the same (1/2, 1/2) is 1, however, the social entropy for acommunity with six students who contribute (1/4, 1/4, 1/4, 1/4, 0, 0) is 2. Although the students in the firstCSCL 2017 Proceedings669© ISLScommunity participate more evenly, and there are two lurkers in the second community, the social entropy indexfor the second group is higher than that of the first group. To compare the evenness of different communities withdifferent numbers of participants and to handle the “lurker” problem, normalization should be obtained by dividingthe entropy by its maximum score log 2𝑚𝑚:H0=H/H max where H max=𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙2 𝑚𝑚The normalized social entropy index ranges from 0 to 1. “1” means perfect evenness, while “0” denotestotal unevenness.Results and discussionsTable 1 shows the number of total notes and total theorizing notes in each class, indicating nearly half of the noteswere coded for depth of understanding in each grade. Figure 1 shows 20 Grade 2 students’ shares of depth ofunderstanding, while figure 2 shows 20 Grade 3 students’ (not the same 20 students in Grade 2) related shares,indicating grade 2 students theorized in an evener manner than that of grade 3.The results of the social entropy measurement are shown in table 2. Except for Grade 3, the idea evennessvalues of other grades seem to fit the optimal level according to Bruno (2010), indicating that students’ depth ofunderstanding in theorizing is distributed in an even and desirable manner in these Knowledge Buildingcommunities. However, it should be noticed that the optimal entropy level (Bruno, 2010) was achieved throughundergraduate students’ wiki participation and only quantitative indicators were used as the parameters. We needto be careful with the generalization of the results.This idea evenness for Grade 2 is much higher than that of Grade 3, which indicates that the depth ofunderstanding of Grade 2 students’ theorizing notes distributed more evenly than that of Grade 3 students’. Also,from figure 1 and figure 2, we noticed that in Grade 3, several students (S5, S11, S17) did not contribute intheorizing, and some students contributed much more than the other students, for example, the depth ofunderstanding in S6’s and S7’s theorizing notes is significantly higher. The idea evenness values of the two classesreflect this kind of different distributions of depth of understanding.Table 1: The description of the number of totalnotes and total theorizing notes in each classNumberGrade1Grade2Grade3Grade4Grade 5/6No. ofnotes370121141272305No. of189theorizing notes86661250.120.10.080.060.040.020167Figure 1.

Each student’s total score of depth of understanding of theorizing noteswas used as the parameter. We found that except for Grade 3, the idea evenness values in other grades are relativelyhigh. Also, the idea evenness values reflect the different distributions of students’ depth of understanding inCSCL 2017 Proceedings670© ISLSdifferent grades (e.g., Grade 2 and Grade 3). The results indicate that students participated in theorizing evenly inmost knowledge building communities, and the social entropy index can be used as an indicator of the distributionof students’ contributions.In this exploratory study, we only considered students’ theorizing notes, given the importance oftheorizing in knowledge advancement (Resendes et al., 2013). The next steps will be taking all notes posted onlineand face to face into consideration, and adding more qualitative indicators, for example, ways of contributing(e.g., original idea creation, connecting ideas, and critical appraisal), collective responsibility (at an individuallevel, intergroup level, and intragroup level) and so forth to the idea evenness measurement. Another issues worthstudying is that right now, if one student contributes more notes, it may compromise the undesirable quality ofhis/her notes. Moreover, the relationship between entropy and students’ learning performance needs to be studiedspecifically with rich knowledge building communities, and the results may inform a teacher how will the levelof entropy in his/her class influence students’ knowledge building and if he/she should take actions to address theidea unevenness issue, if exists.ReferencesBrafman, O., & Beckstrom, R.
