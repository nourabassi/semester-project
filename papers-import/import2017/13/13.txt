Girls’ Interest in Computing: Types and PersistenceMichelle Friend, University of Nebraska Omaha, mefriend@unomaha.eduAbstract: This paper examines interest development through a longitudinal study of youngwomen who had extensive middle school computer science experience. A repeated measuressurvey was conducted at the end of high school and results compared from the end of middleschool to the end of high school. For girls who had developed an interest in a computingcareer by the end of middle school, interest in computing increased. Aspirational expressionsof interest, defined as stating an interest in computing, were highly correlated while embodiedexpressions of interest, defined as engaging in computing activities such as classes, clubs, orhobbies were generally not correlated. Participants appeared more definite in their attitudestowards computing by the end of high school, particularly interest in computing as a careerand college major, than they had at the end of middle school.IntroductionIt is well-documented that women are underrepresented in computing, as early as middle school through theworkforce (NCWIT, 2016). Economists and computer scientists have long made a case that in an increasinglytechnological world, there is an increased need for well-prepared high-tech workers; women could fill thesejobs. Further, diverse teams create higher quality products (Ashcraft & Breitzman, 2012), speaking to not only asocial justice motivation for increasing diversity but also an economic one.Speculation on the role of early experience in developing students’ interest in computing, particularlyengaging underrepresented populations such as women, is rampant. On the one hand, it is widely perceived thatearly experience is important, and so clubs, camps, and programs to introduce children, especially girls, tocomputing proliferate (e.g. Adams, 2010; Ericson & McKlin, 2012). At the same time, little work has been doneto understand the long-term effects of these early experiences. While some programs do engage in high qualityprogram evaluation, longitudinal follow-ups are challenging for informal programs who may have nomeaningful way to track students after the program ends. Further, while engaging workshops and campscertainly can stimulate situational interest described in the Four-Phase Model of Interest Development (Hidi &Renninger, 2006), a short experience may not be enough to sustain the transition to individual interest, though itmay inspire a student to seek out learning opportunities (Barron, 2006). School environments may be bettersuited to support interest development due to the opportunity for repeated re-engagement with the topic requiredin a course.At a time when the “CSForAll” movement is gaining traction in providing computer science courses inschools across the U.S. it is crucial to understand the implications for interest development. On the one hand,providing computer science classes in all schools can provide access and opportunities for students to discover anew passion(Ainley & Ainley, 2011). On the other hand, one lesson of “school science” is that class experiencesdisconnected from the inspirational features of “real science” may diminish students’ interest (Osborne, Simon,& Collins, 2003). It is critical to understand the long-term implications of compulsory school-based computerscience courses on students’ long-term interest.This paper reports on a longitudinal study of girls who attended a middle school where computerscience courses were mandatory. Students were initially surveyed at the end of eighth grade, then re-surveyed atthe end of high school/beginning of college. This paper is descriptive, examining the changes in students’attitudes about computing, as well as differences in their experiences. It examines the long-term effects of earlyexperience and career interest on engagement and continued interest.ContextThis study took place in Silicon Valley, among girls who had attended an all-girls school. Silicon Valley, hometo Apple, Google, and myriad other tech companies, celebrates computing and technology. Further, this studytook place as interest in computing took off, with record enrollment at the college level and increased fundingfor tech startups regularly making the news. While the stereotype of computing as nerdy and unrewardingpersists, the temporal and geographical context of this study, in which computing was seen as financially andsocially rewarding, make it unique.The participants in the study were recruited from a girls’ middle school (grades 6-8) where computerscience was mandatory for all students in all years. The potential stigma of engagement in traditionallymasculine disciplines is removed in a single-sex environment, as everyone doing math, science, and computerCSCL 2017 Proceedings71© ISLSscience is a girl. Many of the confounding factors described in other research, such as boys taking over thekeyboard or boys dominating class discussions to the detriment of girls are not issues in single-sexenvironments. Research has demonstrated that the positive effects of single-sex education persist after womenreturn to coeducational settings, as they take on more leadership roles and have higher confidence than theirpeers who have attended only coeducational schools (Sax, Riggers, & Eagan, 2013).The school provided female role models, as all computer science teachers during this study werewomen. One was a young, blonde engineer; one a pierced & tattooed young computer scientist; and one anolder MIT graduate whose own daughter had previously attended the school. Further, the computer sciencecurriculum was designed to be engaging. It was a breadth-based approach, including robotics, web design,programming with Python and Scratch, database design, animation, as well as deeply conceptual topics such asethics, information flow, object-oriented design, etc. The school had a one-to-one laptop program, and thustechnology use was spread across all classes, with students using word processing in all classes, Excel and otherprograms for science data collection and analysis, and various math applications to examine algebraic functionsand other topics.The setting should be ideal for sparking girls’ interest in computing – project-based hands-oncurriculum, positive stereotype-busting message about computing, female teachers to act as role models,extensive experience and message of competence and mastery, and the larger setting of Silicon Valley wheretechnology careers are celebrated.Research questionsThis work was guided by the following research questions:• How does computing interest vary over time between girls who were open to computing careers at theend of middle school and those who were not?•Are there differences between the expressions of interest as career interest, interest in computinggenerally, level of engagement in computing experiences, and plans to engage in future computingexperiences between the two groups?MethodSetting and participantsThis paper reports on the findings from 40 young women who took surveys on computing attitudes andexperiences at the end of middle school and again at the end of high school. Participants had attended a privategirls’ school in Silicon Valley, California, USA, where computer science is a required course for all students allyears. This provided a baseline of unusually high computing experience.Following middle school, the students dispersed to a variety of high schools. Most attended high schoolat area public (n=26) or private (n=10) schools. While the effects of high school configurations and offeringswere of interest, the population was determined to be too small to make any claims, and this line of inquiry isleft to future work.For this longitudinal follow-up, participants from the first study were asked to participate in a followup survey approximately 3.5 to 5 years after the first data collection, during either participants’ senior year ofhigh school or freshman year of college. This paper reports on data from the 40 participants who completedsurveys at both time points.Procedure and instrumentThe survey was based on an existing survey on interest, access, and experience with technology (Barron, 2004;Friend, 2015). The survey distributed in eighth grade is lengthy and covers not only topics related to computingbut to technology broadly. The middle school survey was distributed by paper in school during the students’final days of eighth grade. For the longitudinal follow-up, a shortened version was distributed through a webform. Most of the questions are repeated measures and were identical in both surveys. In a few cases, questionswere included or updated to reflect participants’ life position (e.g. middle school or high school) as describedbelow.MeasuresMeasures were repeated between the two surveys, updated as necessary to reflect participants’ changed context.In other words, while the middle school survey asked about high school plans, the high school survey askedabout college plans. The following is a brief description of each survey construct analyzed below.CSCL 2017 Proceedings72© ISLSCareer interestOne question asked students if they could see themselves becoming “a computer programmer or engineer ofsome sort” and was used to measure interest in a computing career. This question was used to group the studentsinto a “CS Career” group who were open to a computing career and a “No CS Career” group who were not. Thegroups were created following the middle school survey: those who indicated they “definitely” or “probably”could not see themselves as a programmer or engineer of some sort were put in the “No CS Career” group andthose who indicated they “maybe”, “probably”, or “definitely” could see themselves as a programmer orengineer were in the “CS Career” group. Once assigned to a group, based on the middle school survey, groupmembership was maintained independent of a participant’s response to the question in the high school survey.Computing interestFour questions measured each student’s express statement of interest in computing: “I would like to learn moreabout computers”, “Computers are interesting to me”, “Learning about what computers can do is fun”, and “Ilike the idea of taking computer classes.” Responses were averaged for a single measure of computing interest.Future plansTwo measures were developed to investigate participants’ future plans to engage in computing: interest inmajoring in computer science, and interest in future learning about computing. To determine interest in a CSmajor, the survey asked to what extent participants could see themselves majoring in computer science incollege. Interest in future learning was measured through several questions about to what extent participantscould see themselves participating in a variety of experiences around computing. These included taking moreclasses about computers, taking a class on programming or web design in the next step of their academic career,enrolling in a computer summer program, or “learning about” programming, hardware, simulations, or robotics.ExperiencesParticipants were asked how much they had engaged in various computational experiences. In the middle schoolsurvey, the question asked how many times they had ever done the activities; in the high school survey, thequestion asked how many times they had done the activities in high school, in order to distinguish continuedparticipation after middle school.Classes: Students were asked how many computer science classes they had taken at school.Clubs: Students were asked how many technology-based clubs such as First robotics they hadparticipated in.Hobbies: Participants were asked how much they had done each of thirteen computational activities.Examples of activities included making a robot, designing a 2-D or 3-D model, or making a web site. In theeighth grade survey, one of the activities was “created your own newsgroup, blog, or discussion site on theinternet.” In the high school survey, this question as replaced with “used a makerspace at school or elsewhere”because of the increased prevalence of Maker Spaces in the area, and extent to which creating a newsgroup orblog is no longer a computational activity. “Hobbies” represented the number of activities a participantindicated she had engaged in six or more times. To have engaged in a single activity so many times would bemore than required by a class, and therefore represents an act of volition such as joining a club or engaging inthe activity in their free time, therefore it is considered a computational hobby.AnalysisFollowing the middle school survey, participants were grouped for analysis based on their response to thequestion about seeing themselves as a programmer or engineer. The “CS Career” group responded theydefinitely, probably, or maybe could see themselves as a programmer or engineer in the future. The “No CSCareer” group responded that they could probably or definitely not see themselves as a programmer or engineer.For the purposes of this paper, participants were kept in the same group. Thus, the “CS Career” groupingrepresents whether participants had CS career interest following middle school.Repeated measures analysis was used to compare outcomes between the two groups (O’Brien &Kaiser, 1985).FindingsCareer interestResponses to the question about whether a participant could see herself becoming a programmer or engineerformed the main grouping variable for analysis, as described above. A chi squared test of independence wasCSCL 2017 Proceedings73© ISLShighly significant (Χ2 = 13.7, p < .001), demonstrating that group membership in middle school was stronglyassociated with group membership in high school. Seven participants had high school responses that would haveresulted in a different career group, as summarized in Table 1. The five participants who had been open to a CScareer in middle school and could no longer see themselves as a programmer or engineer had all responded“Maybe” on the original study, so not a large change in attitude. Of the two participants who became open to acomputing career, one moved from “probably not” to “maybe” while the other showed substantial increase ininterest from “probably not” to “definitely yes.”Table 1: Interest in a programmer/engineering job by timeHighSchoolCSCareerNo CSCareerTotalMiddle SchoolCS CareerNo CSCareer8252513(33%)27(67%)Total10(25%)30(75%)The distribution of responses on the five-point Likert scale are shown in Figure 1. Participants appearmore decisive in their feelings about a computing career by the end of high school – the majority who had beenneutral to mildly negative had moved into rejecting the idea more completely, while those who were open to acomputing career had become more positive about it.Figure 1. Programmer Career Interest.Computing interestAs described above, while the participants were grouped by their openness to a computing career, interest incomputing more broadly was also interrogated. “Interest” measures each participant’s response to explicitquestions about her interest in computing, such as “learning what computers can do is fun.”As shown in Figure 2, there is a significant difference in interest between the two groups. A paired ttest on the CS Career group shows an increase in interest between middle and high school (t(12) = 2.16, p = .05)while the No CS Career group does not (t(26) = .70, p = .49). To further investigate, a repeated measuresANOVA was run, which shows a main effect of group (F(1, 38) = 15.59, p < .001) and a main effect of time(F(1, 38) = 4.24, p= .046), but no interaction (F(1, 38) = 1.52, p = .225). This suggests that girls who werealready interested in computing increased interest during high school, but for girls who were not open to acomputing career, their interest in computing is relatively unchanged.CSCL 2017 Proceedings74© ISLSFigure 2. Change in interest by group.Future plansBeyond asking directly how interested participants are in computing, the survey also indirectly measuredinterest through asking about participants’ future plans to engage in computing. Future plans were measuredboth by asking to what extent participants could see themselves majoring in computer science, and also theirplans to participate in computing in less formal ways, such as taking classes and learning independently.Participants in the CS Career group were more interested in majoring in CS (HS M=2.85, SD = 1.46)than participants in the No CS Career group (HS M=1.56, SD=.89), a trend that did not change over time:repeated measures ANOVA shows a main effect of group (F(1, 38) = 34.88, p < .001) but no effect of time orinteraction between time and group. There was high variance in the responses, particularly in the CS Careergroup. Figure 4 disaggregates the CS Career group responses and suggests that individuals are becoming moredecisive in their consideration of a CS major, whether positive or negative.Figure 3. Openness to a CS Major for CS Career group.In contrast to participants’ inclination to major in computer science, their plans to continue learningmore about computing and computer science continues to be high. Repeated measures ANOVA shows a maineffect of group (F(1, 37) = 24.86, p < .001) but no interaction nor main effect of time. In other words,participants in the CS Career group have more intention to continue learning about computing than their No CSCareer peers both in middle school and in high school, and neither group changes intention over time.ExperiencesWhile stating that one is interested in a topic, even interested in pursuing it in the future, is one measure ofinterest, another important factor in interest development is the enactment of that interest through engaging inactivities related to the interest. The high school survey inquired into whether students had taken CS classes orjoined clubs relating to computing. The middle school survey had not asked about these topics because allstudents were required to take computer science classes all years and few clubs were offered due to the smallCSCL 2017 Proceedings75© ISLSsize. Both surveys inquired into the depth of participants experience with a variety of computational activitiessuch as creating web sites, digital art, and programming.Two participants in each group had taken three or more CS classes in high school. While mostparticipants in the CS Career group had taken a CS class (n=8, 62%), most participants in the No CS Careergroup had not taken CS in high school (n=19, 70%). However, a t-test comparing the groups was not significant(t(20)=1.5, p=.14).The results were similar in terms of joining computing clubs. The vast majority of participants in theNo CS Career group had not joined any computing clubs in high school (n=24, 89%), while a smaller majorityof the CS Career group had not joined computing clubs (n=7, 54%). As before, a t-test indicated no significantdifference between the groups’ on joining computing clubs (t(15.9) = 1.79, p=.09).Participants were asked about how often they had engaged in each of thirteen activities, and thenumber of activities where they indicated they had re-engaged more than six times were counted and considereda digital hobby. For example, a student who had created more than six web sites, more than six pieces of digitalart, and more than six robots would have three digital hobbies.There was incredible variation in the number of participants’ digital hobbies, with few trends. Repeatedmeasures ANOVA showed no main effect of time or group and no interaction. A histogram of the responses isshown in Figure 4. In both groups, many participants have fewer hobbies in high school than they did in middleschool. Although on average the number of hobbies demonstrated by participants in the CS Career groupdecreases from middle school to high school, the number of participants reporting no hobbies decreases, fromfour to one. It would be expected that participants who were interested in a computing career would havecomputational hobbies. By contrast, it would be expected that participants who were uninterested in acomputing career may not have computational hobbies. Thus, it is notable that a substantial number ofparticipants did have digital hobbies. Of particular notice is the number of people who had four or more hobbiesin middle school – including the participant who had seven hobbies.Figure 4. Number of computational hobbies by group and time.Relationships between expressions of interestIn order to understand the relationships between the different expressions of interest, not just through the lens ofcareer interest, but across all expressions described above, correlations were calculated, as shown in Table 2.These are correlations of the results from the high school survey.Table 2: Relationship between variablesComp. InterestCS MajorFuture LearningCSCL 2017 ProceedingsCareer.58***.76***.73***InterestMajor.59***.79***.78***76LearningClassesClubs© ISLSHS CS Classes.36*Clubs.50**Hobbies.36** p < .05, ** p < .01, *** p < .001.06.27.14.09.30.18.00.41**.14.29.47**.2Aspirational expressions of interest – defined as being open to a computing career, expressing interestin computing, being open to a CS major, and being interested in learning more about computing in the future were all very highly correlated. Embodied expressions of interest – defined as engaging in activities that woulddemonstrate that interest: taking classes, joining clubs, or having computational hobbies - were generally notstrongly correlated with aspirational expressions of interest. One exception is computing career interest, whichwas moderately correlated with the embodied outcomes.DiscussionTo the extent that “computing interest” can be broadly conceptualized, the prediction would be that studentswho express interest in computing would display that interest broadly, that they would not only agree withstatements such as “I am interested in computing” but would also engage in computing activities and would beopen to future opportunities. The results discussed here present a more complex picture of interest, in whichaspirational expressions of interest – stating that one is interested or would be willing to engage in the future –are markedly different than embodied expressions of interest – actually engaging in the activity, whether bytaking courses, joining clubs, or engaging in computing as a hobby.Within the aspirational expressions of interest, one notable result is the change in computing interestexpressed by the CS Career group, as shown in Figure 2. Not only did members of the group have a higherinterest in computing generally at the end of middle school, but their interest continues to grow in high school –independent of whether they engaged in computing activities. It appears that once girls are “hooked” oncomputing, their interest may continue to increase even if they do not continue to engage in extensivecomputing activities. This could be seen as an expression of individual interest, and that once participants haddeveloped individual interest their interest deepened from emerging to a more well-developed individual interestduring high school. Further investigation is warranted, both through investigating how participants understandand conceptualize their interest in computing, but also whether this is an operationalization of individualinterest, such as identifying the relationship between participants’ identity with computing and expressions ofinterest.In terms of attitudes, participants appeared to become more decisive about their future plans duringhigh school. While a substantial number of participants were “maybe” or “probably not” open to a computingcareer at the end of middle school, by the end of high school a much larger number were definite in theirresponse (see Figure 1). A similar trend occurred with participants’ response to majoring in computer science(see Figure 3). This is not entirely surprising, as younger students may be open to more possible futures thanadolescents who are close to having to choose a path (Eccles, 2007). The finding that participants who weremore positive about computing careers at the end of middle school are more positive about majoring in CS atboth times echoes Tai, Qi Liu, Maltese & Fan (Tai, Qi Liu, Maltese, & Fan, 2006) and suggests that despitetheir mixed engagement in computing experiences in high school they may go on to major in computing areas incollege and even continue to computing careers.The mixed results in terms of participants’ high school experiences warrants further investigation. Oneopen question relates to the participants in the No CS Career group with high experience. The participants whotook many courses, had many hobbies, and joined computing clubs yet reject a future in computing are ofinterest, to understand their choices. It is notable that this study took place in Silicon Valley, where computing isprevalent and privileged. Further their middle school computer science experience included messages about theutility of computing; these participants may have seen computing experiences as a vehicle to other goals.Follow-up study is required to understand the meaning of this finding.Perhaps the greatest area for future research is not explanatory, but one of generalizability. The samplein this study is not only small but also quite unique, both in the general setting of Silicon Valley and also in theparticulars of graduates of a girls’ school with a mandatory computer science curriculum. Future research wouldnot only expand to schools in other settings outside of Silicon Valley but also other configurations of schools.As an increasing number of schools are offering and even requiring computer science courses, finding schoolsand students with high CS experience should become easier, allowing for comparison and generalization of thefindings.CSCL 2017 Proceedings77© ISLSConclusionImplied in the introduction to this paper is the question of what will happen as school-based computing becomesmore prevalent. Will it, as hoped, increase students’ interest as they are exposed to a rich and engagingdiscipline? Or will “school computer science” become like “school science” which in its drive to meet standardsand teach particular content may lose some of the excitement of discovery? This small study taking place in asingle context can only hint at some possibilities, but they are hopeful.For girls whose interest can be aroused, once they are captured, they seem to maintain and evenincrease their interest in computing. This is true even when they do not continue participating. One of theimplications of the discrepancy between aspirational expressions of interest (i.e. stating one is interested) andembodied expressions of interested (i.e. doing the activity) is that it diminishes the importance of continuedopportunities in high school. One concern as computing experiences become more prevalent, particularly in theform of camps and workshops for children, is that if children get excited about computing at a young age butthen have no opportunities for continued engagement such as high school classes or clubs that their interest willdiminish. The results of this study suggest that as long as the interest is more than marginal – if adolescentsexpress even a marginally positive interest – that the interest can be maintained even without the support ofschool opportunities.ReferencesAdams, J.
