Scaffolding Scientific Epistemologies through KnowledgeBuilding Discourse and Epistemic ReflectionFeng Lin and Carol K.K. Chanirisfeng83@gmail.com, ckkchan@hku.hkThe University of Hong KongAbstract: This study investigated how elementary-school children’s science epistemologiescan be fostered in a CSCL knowledge-building environment focusing on epistemic inquiryand reflection. Two classes of fifth graders in Hong Kong participated in a unit of electricitystudy. The design involves students engaging in scientific inquiry, pursuing ideas onKnowledge Forum®, and making epistemic reflection about the inquiry process. A keydesign theme involves children reflecting on their inquiry in relation to scientific practice andcollective theory building. Analyses indicate that online discourse moves reflecting epistemicinquiry (problem-centred uptake and theory building) were correlated with post-test epistemicand conceptual understanding. Classroom and interview analyses showed how students’epistemic practice (e.g., theory revision) and epistemic reflection (connecting their owninquiry and scientists’ inquiry) might have influenced their epistemic development.Implications of how children develop scientific epistemologies supported by epistemic inquiry,discourse and reflection in a knowledge-building environment are discussed.Keywords: knowledge building, CSCL discourse, epistemic views of science, scientific inquiryHelping students understand the nature of science and scientific inquiry has always been the central focus ofscience education. A growing number of studies have been conducted to understand students’ epistemic viewsof science, and its relation to other cognitions (Stathopoulou & Vosniadou, 2007; Tsai & Liu, 2005). However,few studies have examined how it can be fostered, especially how it can be fostered in computer-supportedcollaborative learning (CSCL) environments. The purpose of this study is to examine how a computer-supportedknowledge-building environment may facilitate students’ scientific epistemologies and knowledge advances.Theoretical perspectiveEpistemic views of science and CSCLEpistemic cognition is individual’s understanding about the nature of knowledge and knowing (Chinn,Buckland, & Samarapungavan, 2011). There are different lines of research conceptualizing epistemic cognition(Hofer & Pintrich, 1997; Lederman et al., 2002; Schommer, 1990), among which one line focused on the ideadriven and constructive nature of science. Carey et al. (1989) initiated this line of research and identified threegeneral levels of epistemic understanding among seventh grade students, ranging from viewing science asconcrete activity to viewing it as an idea driven process and as construction of ever-deeper explanations of thenatural world. Later Smith et al. (2000) made a more elaborate study of sixth graders’ epistemologies of science,and differentiated different aspects of the epistemology (e.g., goals of science, the nature of scientific questions,etc.). Chuy, Scardamalia and colleagues (2010) further developed the interview protocol, emphasizing ontheoretical progress. The epistemic cognition framework this study used was based on these previous studiesand examined how students understand science as an idea driven process, and it further extends it to the socialaspect, and focuses on how students understand the collective and progressive nature of scientific progress.Many studies have designed computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environments tosupport students’ scientific inquiry with some indicating that the epistemological design of those environmentscould influence the nature of students’ inquiry process (Clark, Weinberger, Jucks, Spitulnik, & Wallace, 2003).For example, Tan et al. (2005) noted the change of students’ epistemology and scientific inquiry skills in acomputer supported collaborative learning environment. Underlying these designs and technologies is theemphasis on role of epistemology and that scientific knowledge is socially constructed and advances in aprogressive manner. However, how students understand science’s progressive and socially constructed processand how it relates to their scientific inquiry practice is not well examined. We argue here that it is important toexamine how individuals understand science as a collective theory building process and how they understand itssocial and progressive nature, as this may help to explain students’ collaborative knowledge constructionCSCL 2015 Proceedings475© ISLSprocess in CSCL environments. It could also help us to reflect on and improve the epistemic principles of thetechnology used to support students’ collaborative inquiry.Computer supported knowledge buildingAs one of computer-supported inquiry-based models in education, knowledge building has attracted much of theattention in the recent years (Scardamalia & Bereiter, 2006). One essential aspect of knowledge building isstudents taking collective cognitive responsibility for community knowledge advancement. In knowledgebuilding, ideas are viewed as conceptual artifacts that can be constantly improved. To support such knowledgework, Knowledge Forum® (KF) has been created as a communal place where ideas can be worked on in variousways (e.g., linked to other ideas, be visualized with structures, be highlighted with graphs, and be revised, etc.).Scaffolds are also provided for students to work towards knowledge building: “I need to understand”, “mytheory”, “new information”, “a better theory”, “putting our knowledge together”, etc. These epistemic promptmay help develop students’ epistemic understanding about the collective theory building nature of science.A growing number of studies have been conducted to examine the design and effects of knowledgebuilding on students’ science learning (Hakkarainen, 2004; Lee, Chan, & van Aalst, 2006; Oshima &Scardamalia, 1996). Results have shown the role of knowledge building discourse and classroom dynamics onstudents’ understanding (Zhang, Scardamalia, Lamon, Messina, & Reeve, 2007). However, few studies haveexplicitly relate knowledge building with students’ scientific epistemologies drawing upon online and offlinedata (Chan & Lam, 2010; Chuy et al., 2010). Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to address thisissue, and to examine how knowledge building may foster students’ epistemic and conceptual growth. Thispaper is based on a large project that examines the design, processes and effects of a knowledge-buildingenvironment on students’ epistemic and conceptual understanding. In a preliminary study (Lin & Chan, 2014),we have reported on the quantitative findings indicating that knowledge-building students improved more ontheir epistemic and conceptual understanding than the comparison group. This study draws upon the data fromKnowledge Forum, classroom observation, and interviews to examine how the design might have fosteredstudents’ epistemic growth and knowledge advances. Specifically, three research questions are addressed: (1)How do Knowledge Forum inquiry and discourse relate to students’ epistemic and conceptual understanding;(2) How does classroom dynamics including discourse and reflection facilitate students’ epistemic growth; (3)How do students understand their own and scientist inquiry reflected in their interviews? -MethodsParticipants and contextAs noted above, this is part of a large design study. Four classes of fifth graders in Hong Kong participated inthe study, among which two classes (n=52) were engaged in knowledge building and epistemic reflection, forcomparison, the other two (n=50) were taught with regular inquiry-based approach. This paper focuses on theknowledge-building classes.Designing the knowledge-building environment: Students as little scientistsThe key design is to help students work like little scientists engaging in epistemic inquiry and reflecting on theinquiry process collectively. Students pursued ideas (e.g., pose questions/explanation; revise idea) onKnowledge Forum (KF), tested their ideas in experiments; and reflected on their inquiry process integratingonline and offline discourse. The specific designs include: (1) Activate prior epistemic and conceptualunderstanding: Students discussed their initial ideas about electricity and what scientists do in the classroom (2)Authentic problems and inquiry: Students watched a video on experiments about lemon juice/ salt waterconducting electricity, conducted hands-on experiments to test conductivity of different materials; posedwonderment questions and put their ideas and questions on KF; scaffolds were provided (e.g., “I need tounderstand”, “my theory”, “new information”) to facilitate theory building. (3) Deepen inquiry throughexperiments and classroom epistemic talk: Students worked in groups to design experiments to test their KFideas; they reflected on their forum discourse and inquiry and wrote on KF their epistemic understanding; (4)Connect students’ inquiry with scientists’ inquiry through epistemic reflection. Students were scaffold to reflecton the relations between their own inquiry and scientists’ inquiry (5) Knowledge building reflection: Studentswrote portfolio notes on KF to reflect on their collective discourse with knowledge building principles.Analyses and resultsThe previous paper has reported on preliminary analyses; students’ epistemic views of science were measuredwith a written test developed from previous studies (Carey et al., 1989; Lederman & Ko, 2004; Smith et al.,CSCL 2015 Proceedings476© ISLS2000). Four components were identified to characterize epistemic views: (1) role of idea, (2) theory building (3)theory-fact understanding, and (4) social process of scientific progress. The general pattern ranges from viewingscience as concrete activities to seeing it as collective theory building process. Quantitative analysis indicatedthat the knowledge-building group improved more in their epistemic and conceptual understanding than thecomparison group (Lin & Chan, 2014). While quantitative findings show positive effects, questions remain as tohow the designed environment facilitated students’ epistemic and conceptual growth. This study specificallyexamined how Knowledge Forum inquiry (online) and classroom inquiry and dynamics (offline) mightcontribute to the change. Students’ focus group interviews were also examined to explain the change processes.Q1: Examining Knowledge Forum discourse and relations with epistemic andconceptual understandingAmong the two knowledge-building classes, Class 1 students on average wrote 13.2 notes, linked 66.7% of thenotes, and read 30.4% of the total notes. Class 2 students on average wrote 7.5 notes, linked 52.7% and read32% of the notes; these indices are comparable to those in knowledge building research (Lee et al., 2006). Tocharacterize the socio-cognitive-epistemic aspects of knowledge building discourse, analysis of KnowledgeForum notes was conducted both on thread and individual note levels. The notes were first parsed into threads,and coded into three patterns: knowledge sharing (sharing of information), knowledge construction (interactingto construct understanding), and knowledge building (working to extend and create knowledge) (van Aalst,2009). The following excerpt shows an example of a knowledge building thread.Student#5a035a345a16Note contentI don’t understand]: Why can salt conduct electricity?Because salt is a kind of electrolyte[A better theory]: after the experiment, we found that both salt and saltwater can not conduct electricity5a20[You theory can not explain]: After this experiment, we found that salt cannot conduct electricity, but salt water can. Salt water is NaCl, it is ioniccompound, and there are free electrons or ions in it. Therefore it can conductelectricity.5a34[A better theory]: because salt consists of Na+ and C-, Na+ is metal ion, canallow free electron pass through. Na+ and K+ transmit as nerves in our brain,therefore salt can conduct electricity.5a31[I don’t understand]: can anything that does not contain Na+ conductelectricity?5a11[Your theory cannot explain]: Salt is a kind of metal ion, and can conductelectricity; salt water is a kind of soluble liquid with salt. Any liquid that candissolve salt can conduct electricity, because there are free electrons in it,and it is called electrolyte.[My theory]: any liquor with electrolyte can conduct electricity.As the excerpt shows, student 5a03 started with an alternative conception (misconception), asking whysalt conduct electricity. 5a34 proposed a theory that salt is a kind of electrolyte. Then 5a16 used the evidencefrom the experiment to question her classmates’ conception noting salt cannot conduct electricity, but he alsoincluded a misconception noting salt water cannot conduct electricity. 5a20 noted the problem and explainedwhy salt water can conduct electricity (“Salt water is NaCl, it is ionic compound… there are free electrons orions.. it can conduct electricity”). However, 5a34 then proposed a theory to explain why salt conduct electricity.The idea of Na+ from 5a20 and 5a34 brought about an emergent question from 5a31 wondering if anythingwithout Na+ can conduct electricity. That led to 5a11 proposing another theory explaining why salt waterconduct electricity, he used the example of salt water conducting electricity to generate the principle that “Anyliquid that can dissolve salt can conduct electricity, because there are free electrons in it, and it is calledelectrolyte.” Further, he came up with a new theory that “any liquor with electrolyte can conduct electricity.”This example showed how this group of young students worked collectively at something well beyond theircurriculum: they devoted theory-building and knowledge-creation efforts to pose questions and explanations andto continually revise earlier ideas; they provided explanations about why salt water conduct electricity andgradually developed a more abstract theory; new information was embedded along the discussion;misconceptions existed but continually revised. This example showed how study collectively built ideas onKnowledge Forum to advance their community knowledge.CSCL 2015 Proceedings477© ISLSNotes within the conceptual threads were also analyzed quantitatively for understanding discoursemoves. Premised on knowledge building theory, two components were identified: Problem-centred uptake andTheory-Building. (1) Problem-centred uptake discourse moves refer to how coherently the idea was connectedto previous idea to address the original problem and also for deepening the inquiry. Four levels were coded: Atlevel 1, the note makes no/weak connections to the previous note. At level 2, there is vague connection; theresponse is not essential for solving the problem (e.g., ask for elaboration). At level 3, the note has reasonableconnections to the previous note (e.g., give explanations to the previous questions). At level 4, there is coherentconnection in terms of solving the problem (e.g., move discussion back to the problem; rise above; askdeepening question). (2) Theory building includes discourse moves that illustrate efforts to build theory,including initiating inquiry, sustaining inquiry, theorizing (explanation), responding, and using social-cognitiveconflict to spark progress (see Table 1).Table 1: Coding scheme for theory building effortCodeInitiate inquiryTheorizing (low)Theorizing (high)Sustain inquiry (low)Sustain inquiry (high)Response (low)Response (high)Social cognitive conflictNon-build onDescriptionInitiates a thread; starts with a question or a statementProvides simple explanation; intuitively try to provide reasons for a phenomenon.Constructs deep explanation; search for abstract mechanism-process, or the complexobservable mechanism of a phenomenon, incorporated with new information/evidenceAsks simple or superficial questions for elaboration or explanation.Asks deepening question that sustain inquiry for progressive problem solving e.g., askfor explaining the mechanism; emergent questionsResponds to the previous notes with simple factual word or statement (differentiatedfrom explanation that tries to theorize for mechanism).Reasonable and elaborated responses to the previous notes, embedded with newinformation (differentiated from explanation that tries to theorize for mechanism).Identifies problems/misconceptions; questions ideas under discussion to move forwardScattered notes without any build on; or other irrelevant noteCorrelation analysis was conducted to examine the relations of discourse moves with students’epistemic and conceptual understanding (Table 2). Forum participation was examined using a tool calledAnalytic Toolkit and different indices (e.g., read, write, scaffolds) were combined using factor analyses (Lee etal., 2006). Analyses showed that students post-test conceptual understanding was correlated with post-testepistemic cognition, KF participation, KF high problem centred uptake (level 3+level4), and KF explanation andresponse (high). As well, students’ post-test epistemic cognition was correlated with KF high problem centreduptake, KF explanation and response (high), and KF sustain inquiry. These results suggest that students’problem-centred uptake and theory building moves are related to their epistemic and conceptual understanding.Table 2 Correlation among KF discourse, post conceptual understanding, and post epistemic views (n=52)1.Post-test conceptual2.Post-test epistemic3.KF participation (ATK)4.KF high problem-centred uptake5.KF initiate inquiry6.KF explanation &response (high)7.KF sustain inquiry8.KF socio-cognitive conflict9.KF nonbuid on12345678.489**.320*.378**0.126.412**0.1680.218-0.2410.247.339*0.08.292*.289*0.175-0.091.698**0.275.728**.492**.315*.276*0.24.822**.812**.415**-0.0350.1850.2280.1140.201.463**0.19-0.043.482**0.174-0.043Note: *p<.05; **p<.01Q2: Scaffolding Epistemic Discourse and Reflection in the ClassroomThis study also analyzed key themes emerging in the knowledge building classroom reflecting students’epistemic inquiry and practice; online and offline discourse were integrated. There are many key events and theselection was guided by framework emphasizing epistemic reflection and theory building.Epistemic inquiry activating prior knowledge and asking questionsIn the knowledge-building classroom, from the start, the focus is about letting students develop practice ofraising questions and constructing explanations and improving on these ideas. Students asked various questionsCSCL 2015 Proceedings478© ISLSabout electricity (e.g., why does water conduct electricity? What makes conductor conduct electricity?).Question generation is key to scientific inquiry/progress; students posed problems on KF and in class toacculturate students into epistemic practice of problem-centred inquiry. The teacher also scaffolded students toconsider their views of science, and to link their experiments with scientific practice and theory building.Theory revision in scientific and epistemic inquiryThe teacher scaffolded students to understand role of idea and theory revision from their own inquiry experience.To test the various ideas on Knowledge Forum, students worked in different groups to design experiments (eachgroup worked on their question, theory, hypothesis and design in a piece of poster). One group observed thatwater does not conduct electricity, and they proposed a theory (explanation) “it is related to the materials of thecup; the cup that holds water is plastic, which is insulator, and so the water in the cup cannot conductelectricity”. The teacher worked with this group to test their ‘cup theory’. They came up with the idea of testingthe conductivity of water held by different cups (plastic, wooden, and metal). The experiment was conductedand the teacher initiated an epistemic discussion with the whole class after that.SW:we found that even we put the water in different cups, the brightness of light issimilar.T(Teacher): how are these findings different from the group’s hypotheses?SW:It means that the hypotheses about the plastic cup & wooden cup were wrong (theyhypothesized that the water held by plastic and wood cup cannot conduct electricity).T:why are the hypotheses wrong ……Do you still remember the theory?....SC:we observed that the water in the wood cup can make the light a little bit brighter; itmay be related to the impurity in the wood.SG:the light showed similar brightness with whatever cups, it means that…Ss:it has nothing to do with the cups…T:I appreciate SC mentioned something new, he mentioned … [The discussioncontinued…]T:..now suppose you are the scientists, how would you revise your theory[Ss wrote onpapers]SY:it is related to the amount of the waterSM:it is related to the different kinds of water, such as running water, distilled water…This example illustrates how different ideas develop in classroom/KF discussion with students comingup with their ideas (cup theory) tested in experiments, and how students began to see that their theory (idea)need to be tested and revised similar to scientific practice. Another interesting theme is that while the teacherexpected students to discuss based on the central problem (materials of cups), one student SC mentioned someunexpected results and proposed a new theory to explain the phenomenon (the light of the wood cup is a little bitbrighter, maybe related to impurity in the wood), which pointed to experimental error and possibly a newdirection for further inquiry. The process was similar to the emerging process of the mature scientific inquiry,which involves theory testing and theory revision. This experience might have influenced how studentsunderstand science as a theory revision and theory building process.Epistemic inquiry into their and scientists’ knowledge-construction processes.In this knowledge building classroom, to scaffold students to engage in scientific and epistemicinquiry, students were involved in designing, testing ideas, and reflecting on their inquiry. Students wrote on theposter (Figure 1) their experimental design (prompts: problem, theory, hypothesis, design). In the same poster,they also wrote their views of science (prompts; what is science? Are we investigating like scientists? And howdo scientists construct knowledge?). The following excerpt showed an example of the epistemic discussion:Student A: how do scientists construct knowledge?Student B: with their mindStudent Y: by doing experimentStudent W: is that doing experiment can bring us knowledge? I did so many experiments,why didn’t I not construct knowledge?Student Y: because you just do experiment.Student W: but you said scientists do experiment to construct knowledge….CSCL 2015 Proceedings479© ISLSStudent B: by discussion….discuss problems..Student A: are we working like scientists?Student Y: do experiment, and constantly doing inquiry.Student B: we will investigate problems we don’t understand.This example illustrates how epistemic talk, or having students explicitly discuss how scienceknowledge is created, might help them understand more about their own inquiry and nature of science. Thesechildren started with a naïve or impoverished idea (scientists construct knowledge with their mind), andgradually came to understand more about the role of discourse and experiment for constructing knowledge.Though the discourse is still preliminary, children might begin to see more about the constructive nature ofscience and need for sustained inquiry to tackle problems they didn’t understand.Using an epistemic model to reflect on collective theory buildingOne of the culminating activities involves using an epistemic model to scaffold epistemic reflection: The teachershowed students a visual representation (Little Scientists Worksheet) that illustrated a simplified model of thestructure of scientists’ collective inquiry. As Figure 2 shows, Scientist A asks a question, proposes theory A toaddress the research problem; Scientist B questions scientist A’s theory and proposes theory B; Scientist Cfurther improves scientist A’s theory and proposes theory C; Scientist D synthesizes scientist B and scientist C’stheory into theory D. Different arrows are connected to indicate inquiry is an ongoing process. Students wereasked to indicate elements that were similar to what they have experienced. The teacher initiated an epistemicdiscussion among students, as the following example shows.T:You have played different parts… in your inquiry. Many of you asked questions andproposed theories, um..like scientist A… …so [what about] scientist B? Is there noneed for Scientist B?Ss:no, we need scientist B and C to question [them], so that we can improve the theory….T:…None of you mentioned scientist D…?SW: …[we need] scientist D… could combine scientist B and C’s theories, and make abetter theoryThis example suggests how the prototypes of different scientists, in the form of an epistemic model, might helpstudents to see the similarity between what they do and what scientist do illustrated in the model, and thereforemight prompt students to develop a better epistemic understanding about scientists’ inquiry process.Figure 1. Group posterFigure 2. Little Scientists worksheetQ3: Examining students epistemic understanding via interviewsFrom viewing science as inventing concrete things to viewing it as theory building processConsistent with the quantitative findings about the impact of the designed environment on students’ epistemicchange, qualitative analysis of students’ focus group interview also showed that many students initially thoughtof scientists as only doing experiments or inventing things, but that, after the program, they started to understandthe role of idea and social cognitive conflict in science. For example, student CFM said:I used to think that scientists only researched something to help people, but after this semester(after knowledge building), now I understand that scientists not only research something, theywill ask questions, which people don’t know yet… then other scientists will continue to askCSCL 2015 Proceedings480© ISLShim why is that… I thought scientists only invented things, and never thought they proposedtheories.For the students who already had some understanding of the role of idea in science, they mentioned thatthey had further realized how scientists work together to improve knowledge, and spontaneously connected it towhat they did in Knowledge Forum, as one student reflected:“Before, I thought scientists just investigated something, and then made a theory. Now Iunderstand how scientists push each other forward...(Can you explain what you mean by ‘pusheach other forward’).. Just like how we ask questions in Knowledge Forum, then weanswer each other’s questions. Scientists also have their own questions, then other scientists orthey themselves may find the answers, then there will be more questions…and answers. Sothat they can organize their theory…and it kept circulate.”From seeing themselves as knowledge receivers, to seeing themselves as knowledge creatorsTo build and create knowledge, one must not only understand the knowledge-creation process, but must alsobelieve in their capability to create knowledge. Interviews showed that students started to see themselves asknowledge creators, rather than mere knowledge receivers, after their experience with knowledge building, asone student FYL reflected, “I used to think that knowledge only existed in the textbook, actually, we have lotsof problems around us that have not been explored yet.” Another student HBY said, “I also thought knowledgeonly existed in books. [Now I understand that] many people can create knowledge. And we ourselves can alsocreate knowledge...” In addition to believing in their capacity to create knowledge, they also started to seeknowledge creation as a socially constructed process. For example, student CHEN said…Now I think that knowledge can not only be obtained from the book, but also generated byour discussion….it is not only limited to the Internet, books… I now think we ourselves canalso discover knowledge…(Can you explain more about ‘discover knowledge’)…discuss withclassmates. In Knowledge Forum, when someone asked questions, we would try to answer thequestion, while we were thinking and solving the problem, we learned new things….you willrely on some of the material on internet, and incorporate them into your own thinking, andgenerate new knowledge.This excerpt showed that CHEN used to think knowledge could only be obtained from books, but cameto see himself as able to generate knowledge. He also started to think that knowledge was generated byquestions, and was socially constructed. He even mentioned how students could make constructive use ofauthoritative information from the Internet to help them construct knowledge.Discussion and conclusionsThe study investigated how epistemic and conceptual growth could take place in the designed knowledgebuilding environment. Discourse and correlation analysis indicated that students’ high level problem centreduptake and theory building moves were related to post-test epistemic and conceptual scores. Analysis ofclassroom dynamics showed both students’ inquiry in the classroom (problem-generation, theory revision,design experiment to test KF ideas) and how epistemic reflections scaffolded by epistemic inquiry, discourse,and modeling have facilitated students’ change of epistemic and conceptual understanding. The study showedthat it is not adequate just to have students engage in inquiry tasks and forum writing; they need to reflect ontheir inquiry and we scaffold them to reflect on their own inquiry in light of scientists work. Interviews furthershowed the impact of the designed environment on students’ epistemic understanding, and how students havechanged from viewing science as concrete activities to theory building process, and how they started to seethemselves as knowledge creator and to appreciate the role of collective theory building in knowledge creation.This epistemic-enriched knowledge-building design is very different from the traditional inquiry-basedapproach, in which science is portrayed as a series of observation and experimentation, and which neglects therole of ideas in inquiry. The traditional simple inquiry, as Chinn and Malhotra (2002) put it, assumes anepistemology opposed to the epistemology of authentic science. Students’ interpretation of these “artificial”inquiry tasks may affect how they understand the nature of knowledge and science. For example, if studentsmerely do experiments without knowing that the purpose of experimentation is to test ideas, they may notunderstand the role of ideas in science; similarly, if students merely make posts on computer forums, or argueclaims without attempt to improve them, they may not understand that ideas and theories are sociallyconstructed that can be improved through online discourse. Accordingly, one possible explanation for thechanges in epistemic understanding among students might be that underneath knowledge building is anCSCL 2015 Proceedings481© ISLSepistemology that is similar to that of the authentic scientific inquiry, and students’ inquiry and reflection is aprocess of internalizing experts’ epistemology, and therefore a process of improving their own epistemology.This study has shown the possibility of changing students’ understanding of the nature of science through acomputer-supported knowledge building design. Our findings are consistent with the postulation that, if studentsare to understand certain aspects of the nature of science, they must experience those aspects and makemetacognitive reflections thereon (Carey et al., 1989). This study also suggested that the kind of epistemicdiscourse that facilitates connections between scientific inquiry and their own knowledge building inquiry mightbe helpful for epistemic growth. Knowledge building theory (Scardamalia & Bereiter, 2006) postulates thatmembers add value to knowledge production, similar to scientific communities. This design might make thismore explicit with students working as little scientists; engaging in theory building; and reflecting on suchprocesses as scientists and knowledge builders. The study has also identified the need to investigate further howto embed epistemic features, such as the collective, ever-deepening, and progressive nature of knowledge, intoCSCL pedagogy to improve epistemic cognition. Future study can be conducted to further explore the role ofepistemic discourse and reflection in students’ epistemic change process.ReferencesCarey, S., Evans, R., Honda, M., Jay, E., & Unger, C.
