Emergent Roles and Collaborative Discourse Over TimeCatherine Dornfeld, University of Wisconsin-Madison, cldornfeld@wisc.eduSadhana Puntambekar, University of Wisconsin-Madison, puntambekar@education.wisc.eduAbstract: CSCL environments are intended to foster equal participation even when studentroles are not assigned. However, roles may spontaneously emerge and result in distributedparticipation during collaboration, especially when students share and manage a singletechnology resource. We investigated how group discourse shaped emergent roles in acollaborative small group over the course of a 12-week science curriculum with simulatedscience experiments. Group members showed patterns in their discourse contributions in termsof content, function, and initiation and uptake of discourse topics. The emergence of thesepatterns stimulated role differentiation and stabilization. Conceptual discussion appeared toimprove learning gains, while prioritization of task management detracted from learning. Bytracking group discourse patterns, we can observe the process of role emergence in face-toface CSCL interactions.Keywords: roles, emergent, spontaneous, collaboration, discourse, learning outcomesIntroductionCSCL environments are often designed to foster equal participation among group members without explicitlyassigning specific roles. However, roles often emerge during collaborative learning (Strijbos & De Laat, 2010;Strijbos, De Laat, Martens & Jochems, 2005), influencing interactions and learning outcomes. When studentspresent their developing understandings to the group, they open themselves to questions, critique, and requestsfor clarification or justification. This peer-review process, along with a focus on personal or collaborative goals,may impact how roles emerge from interactions (Strijbos & De Laat, 2010).Roles, when self-assigned, are the personal undertaking of certain functions or responsibilities withinthe group that are designed to facilitate group progress towards a goal (Hare, 1994). Emerging roles developspontaneously in response to a collaborative activity, as compared to scripted roles that are prescribed tofacilitate collaboration and maximize learning gains (Strijbos & Weinberger, 2010). Roles emerge from socialinteractions that occur over time (Hoadley, 2010; Jahnke, 2010). Role formation or differentiation occurs whenstudents impose responsibilities or functions on themselves or on other group members by positioningthemselves, positioning others, or responding to others’ positioning moves (Sarmiento & Shumar, 2010).Students who are comfortable divulging their developing knowledge may emerge as conceptual leaders orguides. Other students may take on group management or activity coordination tasks. Some students maydeviate from expectedly “productive” roles and engage in off-task discussion. Ultimately the pattern of rolesthat emerges determines the efficiency of learning (Spada, 2010) and depth of knowledge co-construction forthe group, with certain patterns of roles resulting in more effective learning (De Wever, Van Keer, Schellens &Valcke, 2010; Gu, Shao, Guo & Lim, 2015).CSCL environments impact role formation because of the additional requirement of managingintegrated technology during group discussion. By necessity, role establishment is more structured when a groupshares a single technology resource during a face-to-face learning activity (Jones & Issroff, 2005). As only onestudent can manipulate the machine at a time, the student adopting this role becomes responsible for typing orentering inputs of information. He or she may seek group consensus on these inputs before entering them. Ingroup consensus becomes an issue of concern when session time is limited and task completion is favored overconceptual sharing or exploration (Bruhn, 2000).In this study, we investigated how different types of discourse impacted emergent role formation withina collaborative small group. We also examined how different roles were associated with unbalanced learninggains for group members. Our research questions were: How do emerging roles shape discourse when studentscollaborate in a group? How does role differentiation impact learning gains for group members?MethodsThis study was part of the CoMPASS project (Puntambekar, Stylianou & Goldstein, 2007) designed to examinedeveloping science literacy as students interacted with digital text and other scaffolded tools. The projectincluded a 12-week design-based physics curriculum centered on concepts involving forces, work, energy andmotion as applied to roller coaster design. In the classroom, students utilized the digital text, CoMPASS, and aCSCL 2015 Proceedings380© ISLSroller coaster simulation while collaborating in the same small groups of three to five throughout the unit.Students recorded notes in their scientists’ journals, which prompted students to individually and collaborativelygenerate questions and hypotheses, experiment within the simulation, record observations and data, and makeconclusions about physics concepts and relationships. Data relevant to this study included video and audiorecordings of 14 simulation experiments and pre- and post-measures of physics conceptual understanding.ParticipantsThis study focused on a subset of students from the larger study sample. We selected one balanced-gender groupof four sixth-grade students (N=4) based on relatively high variability in post-assessment scores and availabilityof video data for analysis. These students are identified as Michael, Scott, Sandra and Amy for this study. Theyparticipated in a classroom of 22 students composing six groups total. They attended a large suburban publicmiddle school in the US Midwest (U.S. Department of Education, 2013). In the 2011-2012 school year, 85.1%of the students were white and non-Hispanic, and 18.7% were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch (U.S.Department of Education, 2013).Procedure and measuresWe analyzed data for general observations of trends in discourse. The first author noted that students in thissubset of the sample tended to perform the same discourse moves throughout the curriculum. The same groupalso had highly variable learning gains as measured by a conceptual understanding assessment (see nextparagraph). To further investigate this pattern, video and audio data recordings of 14 simulation experimentswere prepared for analysis.We used a CoMPASS-designed physics test (“Physics Fiesta”) to measure conceptual change shown aspre-post differences in assessment scores. This test consisted of 29 questions pertaining to concepts andrelationships involving forces, work, energy, friction, and Newton’s Laws. Correct items earned one point whileincorrect items were given zero points. A score of 29 points was the highest possible score.AnalysisQualitative analysisWe imported video and audio data into Transana data analysis software for synchronization and transcription.We transcribed a total of 2,759 turns of talk over 14 sessions. We compiled these transcripts in Microsoft Exceland evaluated for general patterns prior to in-depth analysis. We designed a coding scheme using groupdiscourse as the unit of analysis to identify discourse moves associated with emerging roles (see Table A1 inAppendix). The two-dimensional coding scheme identified initiation or uptake of topics (Discourse Action) andcontent (Discourse Type) in turns of talk (Strijbos & Stahl, 2007; Hmelo-Silver & Barrows, 2008; Van Aalst,2009). An external coder familiar with the project helped establish inter-rater reliability; inter-rater percentageagreement was 85.64% after an initial round of 10% of total codes (281 turns of 2,759 total) and 99.82% afterresolving differences through discussion. The first author coded the remaining turns, using multiple codes whenappropriate. The coding scheme was not applicable to 13.16% of turns. We collapsed codes into threecategories: Conceptual, Procedural and Negotiation, and Social (see Table A1). We created discourse profilesfor each student. We created CORDTRA diagrams to visualize discourse contributions over time (Hmelo-Silver,Liu & Jordan, 2009).Quantitative AnalysisWe calculated the frequencies and proportions of total and collapsed discourse codes. Proportions allowed us toevaluate patterns in discourse contributions for less dominant speakers whose contributions were obscured bymore dominant speakers. Proportions of each discourse group by code were categorized into student profiles forcomparisons. Dependent-sample t-tests were utilized in analyzing differences in discourse contributionfrequencies between students and simulations (de Winter, 2013). Percentage learning gains were calculated forthe Physics Fiesta assessment.FindingsEmerging roles over timeWe investigated role emergence by comparing proportions of discourse contributions for each group memberover the entirety of the 12-week curriculum; a temporal examination of contributions to specific discourse typesprovided insights into role differentiation and stabilization. Table 1 shows the proportions of discourse types forCSCL 2015 Proceedings381© ISLSeach student; proportions were calculated as contributions to each type of coded discourse. Figure 1 shows thediscourse contribution profiles for each student as total contributions, which were then subdivided into initiation(Initiating) and uptake (Following) of discourse topics.Each student showed a unique pattern in contributions to discourse types. Michael was the greatestoverall contributor to total discourse (1049 turns), followed by Amy, Sandra and Scott (729, 567, and 405 turns,respectively). When comparing individual student profiles for total discourse contributions, we see that Michaelcontributed the most to conceptual discourse (.224), Sandra to procedural discourse (.762), and Scott to socialdiscourse (.221). Amy showed a mixed-discourse profile indicating more balanced participation. Observationsof initiation and uptake of discourse topics reflected similar contribution patterns. Michael tended to initiateconceptual and social talk (.291 and .171, respectively), while Amy and Sandra initiated procedural talk (.754and .800, respectively). Scott followed up on social talk (.281), while Sandra continued discussions related tosimulation procedures (.740). Amy and Michael followed discourse topics of all types.Table 1: Proportions of discourse contributionsDiscourse TypeConceptualProceduralSocialConceptualProceduralSocialConceptualProceduralSocialTotalInitiatingFollowingScott0.1930.5870.2210.2140.6300.1560.1730.5460.281Amy0.1830.6820.1340.1720.7540.0730.1900.6410.170Michael0.2240.5970.1800.2910.5380.1710.1850.6300.185Sandra0.1210.7620.1170.1060.8000.0940.1300.7400.130Proportion of Discourse0.6000.5000.4000.3000.200Conceptual Discourse0.100Procedural DiscourseSocial DiscourseTotalInitiatingSandraMichaelAmyScottSandraMichaelAmyScottSandraMichaelAmyScott0.000FollowingStudentFigure 1. Student profiles of discourse contributionsWe evaluated individuals’ discourse contributions over the entire curriculum to explore a potentialassociation between changes in students’ discourse contributions and role formation. As students establishedroles, their contributions became more consistent. Dependent-sample t-tests were used to compare frequenciesof student discourse contributions during simulations at beginning, middle and end time points of the unit(Sim1, Sim7, and Sim14, respectively). Results of t-tests are shown in Table 2. Amy and Michael contributedmore from the beginning of the unit to the midpoint and from the midpoint to the end, but these increases wereCSCL 2015 Proceedings382© ISLSnot significant (p = .074 and p = .388; p = .428 and p = .359, respectively). Sandra significantly increased hercontributions from the beginning to the midpoint (p = .035) and continued to increase her contributions at a nonsignificant level in the second half (p = .616). Scott was the exception; despite a significant increase incontributions in the first half of the unit (p = .022), he contributed significantly less in the second half (p = .048).Table 2: Dependent-sample t-test results for frequency of discourse contributions over timePairedSimulationsMeanSim1-Sim7-7.667Sim7-Sim146.333AmySim1-Sim7-5.000Sim7-Sim14-5.000MichaelSim1-Sim7-3.500Sim7-Sim14-6.167SandraSim1-Sim7-5.333Sim7-Sim14-2.000*Result is significant at p < 0.05StudentScottStd.

Frequency of contributions to differentdiscourse types varied over time. Figure 2 represents how contribution frequencies changed over the curriculum(shown by Discourse Type; see Appendix). Reports were the most regularly contributed conceptual discoursetype throughout the curriculum (326 turns). Conceptual Explanations were given more often in the first half andnear the end, while Science Practices Explanations were mostly given at the end. Predictions were made moreoften in the first half of the curriculum; a similar pattern exists for Conceptual Questions. Monitoring,Agreement/Acceptance and Disagreement were procedural discourse types contributed with near-constantregularity. Social discourse was present mainly as Off-Task discussions. Statements of Conflict increasedtowards the end. The Initiating and Following contribution patterns indicated that students rarely continued aconversation topic for an extended period of time but frequently started new topics of discussion instead.1312Off-Task11Conflict10Disagreement9Agreement/Acceptance8Monitoring7Conceptual Question6Prediction5Science Practices Explanation4Conceptual Explanation3Report2Following1Initiating00250 500 750 1000 1250 1500 1750 2000 2250 2500 2750Turns of TalkFigure 2.

Scott contributed to social discussion, primarily as continued engagement in off-tasktopics. Amy did not contribute a specific type of discourse but actively participated in conceptual and proceduraldiscussions. Excerpts from the transcripts reflect this pattern (see below). Michael actively initiated andparticipated in conceptual discourse by predicting or explaining patterns in the data. Amy requested elaborationsand justifications from Michael while aiding Sandra in maintaining group focus on the task. Scott listened togroup debate and contributed his opinion when not participating in social discourse. The following excerpts areillustrative of the emergence of Michael’s conceptual role, Sandra’s manager role, and Amy’s negotiation ofexperiment input values:Excerpt 1Michael:It’s going to be 3. 3.4 newtons.Amy:Wait, how many [joules] do you think it’ll be?Michael:3.49 newtons. 3.49 newtons! It’s going to be 3 joules. Going to be 3 joules. It’sgoing to be – aww, what? 2.9.Excerpt 2Amy:I think we should do 3 anyway.Michael:I think we should do 2.5. That works.Sandra:It’s not going to help if we take a vote. It’s going to be two on two.Michael:‘Cause 3 just stopped it too fast. It’s not fair. It’s not scientific-y.Amy:Let’s just do it.Michael:No, it’s not fair. Why do you guys think it’s 3?Amy:Because, um, it takes, um, less [unintelligible] and less track to stop it and it’sstill safe and efficient.Michael:2.5 was more efficient. Uh, 2.5 is more safe, and it still doesn’t take that muchtrack.Excerpt 3Michael:The velocity is going to be 4.43 m/s.Amy:Right?Michael:Work?Sandra:Yeah.Michael:Work. It’s going to be 4.43 m/s. Yeah. And then the kinetic energy and the[total] mechanical energy at the bottom will be 5.9. I called it. I’m done. Thevelocity for all of them – it’s just going to be 4.43 J. I mean 4.43 m/s. And thenthe kinetic energy is total final energy at the bottom is going to be the same asinitial P.E. and total initial energy.Learning outcomesLearning outcomes were evaluated because of the potential impact of collaboration quality on learning gains.Pre- and post-measures of physics conceptual understanding were assessed with the Physics Fiesta test.Learning gains were calculated first as pre-post differences and then as percentages (difference in score wasdivided by the initial score). Michael experienced the greatest learning gain (~77%). Scott and Amy also showedlearning gains (~11%) despite contributing mainly to non-conceptual discourse. Sandra demonstrated a loss oflearning of approximately 17%.CSCL 2015 Proceedings384© ISLSDiscussionThis study investigated how discourse in a collaborative small group shaped role emergence and how adoptionof emergent roles impacted learning gains for each student. Using a small sample allowed fine-grained analysisof ethnographic data collected over multiple weeks of an entire unit, permitting generation of holistic studentprofiles.Roles emerged over time as a result of individual contributions to group discourse. Each studentdemonstrated a dominant discourse type evidenced by proportions of discourse contributions (see Table 1 &Figure 1). The initiation and uptake of discourse topics also revealed student-specific patterns related to roledifferentiation. Students may have contributed more frequently to particular discourse types because of personalinterest or proficiency in a specific responsibility or content area (Strijbos & Weinberger, 2010). For example, astudent interested in conceptual relationships may state unsolicited hypotheses regarding what will happen nextin an experiment. As students performed discourse moves, the group underwent a dynamic process of talkdifferentiation and distribution (De Wever et al., 2010; Hoadley, 2010). The performance and adoption ofcertain discourse moves by individuals over time structured group interactions and initiated role emergence(Strijbos & Weinberger, 2010).Students’ consistent patterns in discourse participation shaped role formation (Hoadley, 2010). Asstudents adopted roles, the roles reinforced their discursive tendencies, especially in initiation and uptake ofdiscussion topics. This reinforcement resulted in a stabilization of discourse contributions and thus persistenceof roles through the end of the curriculum (De Wever et al., 2010). The dependent-sample t-tests indicated that aprocess of initial role formation and subsequent stabilization occurred via individual discourse contributionsover time. Michael’s non-significant increase in contributions indicated that he immediately established his roleas conceptual guide. The other students showed greater increases in contributions in the first half of thecurriculum, indicating a responsive role differentiation stage (De Wever et al., 2010; Hoadley, 2010). The lackof significant increases in the second half of the curriculum indicated role stabilization. The decline in meancontributions for Scott and Michael may be due to a discouragement of social discourse as the group becamemore task-oriented. Figure 2 shows largely consistent patterns in whole-group discourse contributions with theexception of relatively rare conceptual discourse types. This likely resulted from the undertaking of conceptualtalk by a single student (e.g. Michael), indicating that conceptual discourse was role-specific in this case. Theconsistency in procedural contributions may have reflected an urgency to complete the task in limited time.Although the sample size of this study is too small to make claims about learning gains, the emergenceof specific roles for each student may be related to learning gains or losses. Michael verbalized observations,explanations, and other types of conceptual discourse; he also experienced the greatest learning gain. Sandra, onthe other hand, managed the technology for the group in each session while planning the task and negotiatinginput values. Her narrow focus on the task may have limited her participation in conceptual discourse, possiblycontributing to her learning decrease on the conceptual assessment. Interestingly, both Scott and Amy showedmodest learning gains despite Scott’s participation in social discourse and Amy’s balanced participation in alldiscourse. Overall, this discourse-role-achievement pattern aligns with the findings of Gu et al. (2015); thefunctions of particular roles lend themselves to variable conceptual achievement, with task management rolesresulting in lower achievement. The initiation and uptake patterns also indicated short discussion lengthsthroughout, which may have limited potential conceptual gains.Unfortunately procedural discussion pertaining to experiment planning and negotiation of input valuespredominated over conceptual talk. These findings align with those of Strijbos et al. (2005), who found that rolebehavior emerged through task planning instead of discussion of relevant concepts and principles. Thepreponderance of procedural talk may have reduced contributions to conceptual discourse because of limitedsession time, forcing conceptual and procedural ideas to compete for student attention. Students may have faceda dilemma between exploring data patterns and completing the assigned task. With limited time, studentsenacting the manager role may prioritize procedural discourse over exploratory conceptual talk out of necessity;their participation in conceptual discussion is reduced as a result. This limitation could be evenly distributedamong group members so no one student is limited in conceptual discussion. Future implementations could a)expedite negotiation of experiment inputs by requesting justifications in advance, and b) schedule rotation of thetechnology manager role if single-student manipulation is stipulated (Strijbos & Weinberger, 2010; Gu et al.,2015). Spada (2010) has summarized alternatives to role rotation, such as intentional distribution of expertise.The primary limitation of this study was the small sample size, which reduced the availability ofparametric testing and limited generalizability. This study was designed to be an in-depth analysis of a singlegroup’s emergent role process, but future studies with multiple groups could determine if the pattern betweenemergent roles and learning outcomes is consistent. Replication could reinforce the association betweenobserved discourse patterns and emergent roles and support a potential link between role differentiation andCSCL 2015 Proceedings385© ISLSlearning gains. Comparison groups should include students of greater diversity in demographic backgrounds;our current study is limited in generalizability in that regard. Additionally, the assessment for physics conceptualunderstanding may have not captured full learning gains from the implementation as it was administered at theend of the school year and did not impact school grades, potentially altering the level of motivation or cognitiveeffort expended by students on this post-measure.Implications and conclusionThe implications of this study mainly relate to the debate surrounding scripting of roles (Hoadley, 2010; Strijbos& Weinberger, 2010; Spada, 2010; De Wever et al., 2010; Strijbos & de Laat, 2010). CSCL environments areengineered to foster equal participation, but this may not occur for many reasons. While there are multiplestudies of how to optimize scripting for collaborative groups, our study’s focus on emergent roles in face-to-facetechnology-enhanced collaboration is unique. Students in CoMPASS classrooms are familiar with each otherand have pre-existing perceptions or expectations of one another; these attitudes may influence the socialreinforcement of emerging roles and discourse moves. These interactions are crucial to knowledge coconstruction and should be facilitated so that students have equal opportunities to act in each role, at leasttemporarily, before role stabilization occurs. By rotating the roles within the group, especially those involvingcontrol of technology resources, we may improve the distribution of learning gains for group members. Furtherinvestigations into processes of role formation provide opportunities for curriculum designers to differentiateand distribute roles in ways that maximize collaboration benefits for each student.ReferencesBruhn, J.
