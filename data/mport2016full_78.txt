Therefore, we investigated to what extent a collaboration script helps studentsovercome their problems and acquire mathematical argumentation skills. In two previousstudies, we showed that collaboration scripts can have positive effects on learning cross-domainargumentation skills in the mathematical context. Yet, the effectiveness of the script dependedon individual prerequisites such as final high school grade (GPA) and self-regulation skills. Inthis study, N = 96 participants learned in one of three script conditions. We found that a highstructured domain-general collaboration script for argumentation was more effective foracquiring domain-specific mathematical argumentation skills than a low-structured or anadaptable one. Furthermore, only in the condition with the low-structured script, learners’ selfregulated learning skills played an important role for the learning outcomes.Keywords: mathematics, argumentation, collaboration scriptsMathematical argumentationArgumentation is a common mode for knowledge-generating dialogues in social science, politics, or everydaynegotiation. Against this background, investigating the potentials of argumentation for knowledge-generation ina mathematical context might not be that intuitive. Yet, argumentation also plays an important role in mathematics,both in informal mathematical reasoning (Thurston, 1994) and even more so when it comes to formal proof, whichis considered the ultimate form of mathematical argument. Finding promising conjectures and constructingmathematical proofs typically requires the use of heuristic strategies (rather than algorithms) and frequentcomparisons between the promises and problems of different solution strategies (Reiss et al., 2008). Moreover,the construction of an acceptable proof requires the repeated production and evaluation of single arguments aswell as of the structure of the overall argumentation. This process of proof construction, which is “usually heldinformally between mathematicians to develop, discuss or communicate mathematical problems and results”(Douek, 1999, p. 129; see also Thurston, 1994), can be considered a substantial argumentation process, requiringjustifications of the strategic decisions as well as the mathematical inferences made. Thus, during the process offinding a mathematical conjecture or proof, argumentation skills are required at different points either to constructsound arguments, e.g. with the components introduced by Toulmin’s (1958) model of argument (Pease, Smaill,Colton, & Lee, 2009), or to be able to engage in an argumentative dialogue.According to an experts’ process model proposed by Boero (1999), this process comprises phases ofexploration as well as phases of consolidation of arguments into a deductive chain. The explorative phases areexecuted in a rather tentative way that includes revisions of steps made before. The discussion with others duringthose phases seems to be a promising way to frequently evaluate and strengthen the chosen approach to solve theproof task, since the others could bring new ideas and perspectives to refine ideas and arguments. Other phasesinclude the selection and organization of coherent arguments which ideally lead to the formal proof requested bythe initial task (for elaborated descriptions of the process of proof see Boero, 1999; Reiss, et al., 2008), whichrequire evaluation of the arguments according to standards of the discipline. Also this evaluation process canbenefit from monitoring by collaboration partners.Apart from supporting problem solving processes, the engagement in an argumentative dialogue hasmore benefits to offer. The process of constructing and applying arguments in a social discursive collaborativelearning process is ascribed a high potential for deeper elaboration of the learning content and thus a key moderatorfor the enhancement of learning processes (“arguing to learn”; Andriessen, Baker, & Suthers, 2003). Even thoughthe formal rules for accepting proofs are quite specific to mathematics, general guidelines for the construction ofarguments in a collaborative discussion as well as for a sustainable social discursive process of argumentationbetween dialogue partners are considered to be more or less applicable to other domains as well. For instance,Toulmin’s (1958) argument model is widely used for the evaluation of single arguments in multiple domains (vanICLS 2016 Proceedings599© ISLSEemeren & Grootendorst, 2004). Also the dialectical format of argumentation - simplified as the cycle of‘argument’, ‘counter-argument’, and ‘synthesis’ - might function as a common ground for social discursiveactivities where two or more dialogue partner are engaged in an argumentative discourse (Leitão, 2000). Studieshave detected that students often struggle when trying to construct valid mathematical argumentations (e.g.Heinze, Reiss, & Rudolph, 2005). Students are also often not able to engage in a deeper elaborative dialogue whilelearning collaboratively (Cohen, 1994). As students have problems effectively using argumentation inmathematical learning processes (Hillbert et al., 2008), it is important to find ways to appropriately scaffoldstudents’ argumentation in the context of mathematical proof tasks.Scaffolding mathematical argumentationOne way to help students to acquire knowledge and skills related to mathematical argumentation is by offeringcollaboration scripts for argumentation. Collaboration scripts aim at guiding students through meaningful andbeneficial collaborative learning processes by distributing roles and activities among the students (King, 2007;Kollar, Fischer, & Hesse, 2006). Collaboration scripts have shown to be effective in both face-to-face andcomputer-supported collaborative learning (e.g. O’Donnell & Dansereau, 1992; Rummel & Spada, 2005,Weinberger, Fischer, & Mandl, 2003). For the design of collaboration scripts, an explicit referencetoargumentation frameworks proved to be helpful. For example, Weinberger, Stegmann and Fischer (2010)developed a script that guided students through an argumentative discourse by offering explicit support on crucialpoints in the argumentation process. For instance, when students were supposed to construct arguments orcounterarguments, they were asked to address single elements of Toulmin’s (1958) argument model (e.g. claim,data, qualifier). In other computer-supported collaboration scripts, students’ discourses were guided bydistributing the roles of discussants (e.g. De Wever, Schellens Van Keer, & Valcke, 2008) or by prompting themto perform single activities of a discursive argumentation cycle (e.g. Hron, Hesse, Cress, & Giovis, 2000).In recent studies, the collaboration script approach has been transferred to the mathematical domain aswell. In an own study, an argumentation-related collaboration script showed positive effects on students’ crossdomain argumentation skills (Kollar et al., 2014), both in the learning process and a subsequent individual posttest.However, positive effects on domain-specific mathematical argumentation skills could not be found.Additionally, in this study the final high school qualification grade (GPA) was significantly related to theeffectiveness of the collaboration script on domain-general argumentation skills. The better the GPA grade, themore the students benefited from the collaboration script (Kollar et al.,, 2014). Yet, in other domains, collaborationscripts were found to exert positive effects on domain-specific learning (e.g. Weinberger, et al., 2010), albeit notconsistently. As the GPA was such an important factor for the effectiveness of the collaboration script in the studyby Kollar et al. it can be hypothesized that the used collaboration script did not offer enough hints and structure,especially for learners with lower GPA.A further criticism that is often raised against the use of collaboration scripts to support collaborativelearning efforts is that collaboration scripts may structure learners’ activities in a too rigid way. This might leadto “overscripting”, i.e. that the collaboration script inhibits learning by constraining learners in using their own,possibly effective learning strategies (Dillenbourg, 2002). One way to avoid overscripting is to offer the learnersadaptive collaboration scripts. These collaboration scripts would automatically be adapted to a learner’s currentneeds (e.g. Diziol, Walker, Rummel, & Koedinger, 2010). Unfortunately, such adaptive learning scenarios areenormously complex and expensive to develop. Therefore, a more feasible way to avoid overscripting might beto create adaptable collaboration scripts that give the learners themselves the possibility to adapt the script to theirown needs. Yet, the learners might need a certain amount of self-regulation skills to benefit from such adaptablelearning scenarios (Vogel et al., 2015).Goals of the studyThe goal of this study was to compare the effects of a high-structured collaboration script, a low-structuredcollaboration script and an adaptable collaboration script in the context of mathematical proof tasks on students’acquisition of mathematical argumentation skills. Furthermore, we investigated to what extent the learner’s GPAand their self-regulated learning skills would be related to learning in each of the three collaboration scripts. Inline with prior research, we expected the high-structured collaboration script to have a more positive impact onlearning mathematical argumentation skills than the low-structured collaboration script. Furthermore, we alsoexpected students in the adaptable script condition to outperform students who received the low-structuredcollaboration script, as the adaptable script offers each learner the amount of structure s/he (thinks s/he) needs.Therefore, we expected that the self-regulated learning skills would be positively related to learning especially inthe condition with the adaptable script, but also in the low-structured condition since both offer learners theICLS 2016 Proceedings600© ISLSopportunity to self-regulate their learning much more strongly than the high-structured script. We expected theGPA to be positively related to learning in the low-structured script condition.Research questionsRQ1: To what extent does a low-structured collaboration script, a high structured collaboration script and anadaptable collaboration script affect learner’s acquisition of mathematical argumentation skills?RQ2: To what extent are the learners’ self-regulated learning skills related to learning mathematicalargumentation skills when learning with either a low-structured, a high-structured or an adaptablecollaboration script?RQ3: To what extent is the learners’ GPA related to learning mathematical argumentation skills whenlearning with either a low-structured, a high-structured or an adaptable collaboration script?MethodsParticipants and designThe study was implemented in a two weeks preparation course that was conducted at three different Germanuniversities in fall 2011. Participants were N = 96 (n = 58 female; n = 38 male) mathematics students andmathematics teacher students at the beginning of their university studies. Their mean age was M = 19.53 years.The students were randomly assigned to the three treatment conditions (1) low-structured argumentation script (n= 29), (2) high-structured argumentation script (n = 34) and (3) adaptable argumentation script (n = 33).In each condition, we grouped students in dyads of high as well as low achievers, based on their finalhigh school qualification grade. For each of the three learning tasks, we randomly formed new dyads within thehigh and low achievers groups nested in the experimental conditions to minimize the impact on knowledgeacquisition one specific learning partner might exert on a given learner.Figure 1. Screenshot of the computer-supported learning environment with the proof problem on the left side,script prompts on the upper right side and the communication area below the script prompts on the right side.Setting and learning environmentStudents learned collaboratively in dyads in a computer-supported learning environment (see Figure 1) on threedifferent problem solving tasks in the context of mathematical proof. Additionally to the proof tasks, the learningenvironment offered six driving questions derived from Boero’s steps of mathematical proof (Nadolski, Kirschner,ICLS 2016 Proceedings601© ISLS& van Merriënboer, 2006). The learners were seated vis-à-vis each other and each learner was equipped with onelaptop, a graphic tablet and a mouse. The two learners of each learning dyad were connected via a computersupported learning environment that displayed the current mathematical proof task and the script prompts in therespective treatment conditions. The computer-supported learning environment provided the learning task itselfand a shared communication area where the two learning partners could exchange text messages as well asdrawings. They were also asked to type the most important results of their discussion into the communication areaeven though they were also allowed to discuss orally.Conditions of the learning environment and learners’ pre-requisitesType of collaboration script. Three types of collaboration scripts were compared in this study: a low-structuredscript, a high-structured script and an adaptable script. The students were asked to collaboratively discuss theirideas about the proof tasks in all treatment conditions. In the condition with the low-structured script, promptsrepeatedly sequenced the discussion into the phases (1) argument, (2) counterargument and (3) synthesis. Duringeach phase, prompts distributed the roles of ‘talker’ and ‘listener’ to the learning partners. The roles were switchedfor every new argument cycle. . In the condition with the high-structured script, students were additionallyprompted to formulate sound arguments (i.e. to formulate claims, data and rebuttals based on Toulmin’s, 1958argumentation model) in each of these three steps. In the condition with the adaptable argumentation script,learners were allowed to choose between the high structured and the low structured argumentation script at sixpoints in time within each treatment session (see Figure 2). Before they adapted the script, the learners had todiscuss which script they wanted to take in order to come to a joint solution.Figure 2. Screenshot of the decision screen with two buttons to adapt the script either into a high-structured orinto a low-structured script.GPA. For the GPA as moderator variable the students were asked for their final high school qualificationgrade. The grades ranged from 1.00 to 3.50 with an average grade of 1.94.Self-regulation skills. Self-regulation skills were measured with an 18-items questionnaire (adapted fromFisher, King, & Tague, 2001) in which students rated the extent to which they typically apply certain selfregulation strategies (e.g.; “I prefer to plan my own learning”; “I am systematic in my learning”). The resultingscale proved reliable (Cronbach’s α = .77).ICLS 2016 Proceedings602© ISLSInstruments and outcome measuresTo analyze students’ individual learning outcomes, we conducted parallel pre- and post-tests one day before andafter the treatment phases, comprising 17 open items each (cf. Kollar et al., 2014). Five items on schematicargumentation with elementary rules from number theory (e.g., “Show that for all natural numbers, a and b, thefollowing statement is true: If 7 divides a+3b then 7 divides 2a+13b.”), which required transformations of thealgebraic expression and application of rules from the courses’ number theory lectures. Proof skills in elementarynumber theory were examined by six items (e.g., “Prove the following statement: The sum of five consecutivenumbers is divisible by five.”), and six items tested performance in open-ended argumentation problems (e.g.,“Prove or refute the following statement for natural numbers a and b: If you multiply the sum of a and b with thedifference of a and b, you will always obtain an even number.”). Two trained, independent raters coded all items.Inter-rater reliability was good (Mean of ICCunjust = .79). Where discrepancies remained, raters discussed themuntil they reached a consensus. Reliability was good for both tests (Cronbach’s alpha: α = .82 for the pre-test, α =.80 for the post-test). For the statistical analyses all scores were merged and scaled to values between zero (nothingcorrect at all) and one (everything correct).ResultsFirst, we checked if the three script conditions differed in the pre-test mathematical argumentation skills of theparticipants. An ANOVA did not yield significant differences (F(2,93) = 2.10, n.s.). To answer the first researchquestion, an ANCOVA with pre-test mathematical argumentation skills as a covariate was conducted.Mathematical argumentation skills10.90.80.70.60.50.40.30.20.10low­structured script high­structured scriptadaptable scriptFigure 2. Learners’ mathematical argumentation skills by script condition.The descriptive statistics showed that regarding the outcome score, learners in the high-structured script conditionoutperformed the learners in the adaptable script condition. Learners in the low-structured script condition reachedthe lowest outcome score for mathematical argumentation skills. The ANCOVA revealed a significant effect ofthe script conditions on students’ acquisition of mathematical argumentation skills (F(2,92) = 3.91, p = .02, part.η² = .08). Post-hoc comparisons between the three levels of the independent variable showed that it was thecondition with the high-structured script (M = 0.58, SE = 0.02) that reached significantly higher results inmathematical argumentation skills than the condition with the low-structured script (M = 0.50, SE = 0.02). Theadaptable script condition (M = 0.53, SE = 0.02) was not significantly different from the high- and low-structuredscript (see Figure 2).To answer research questions RQ2 and RQ3, we conducted regression analyses in each of the threeconditions with pre-test mathematical argumentation skills, self-regulation skills and GPA as predictors and post-ICLS 2016 Proceedings603© ISLStest mathematical argumentation skills as dependent variable. Results of the regression analyses showed that onlyin the low-structured script condition, self-regulation skills were significantly and positively related to theacquisition of mathematical argumentation skills. GPA was no significant predictor at all for post-testmathematical argumentation skills (see Table 1). Also, in all conditions the pre-test mathematical argumentationskills served as significant predictor for the post-test argumentation skills.Table 1: Regression models for learning mathematical argumentation skills within each of the three conditions.BSE Bβlow-structured script1Pre-test mathematical argumentation skills0.7080.116.738***Self-regulation skills0.1090.051.264*GPA0.0490.038.202high-structured script2Pre-test mathematical argumentation skills0.6330.109.742***Self-regulation skills0.0020.056.005GPA0.0330.041.100adaptable script3Pre-test mathematical argumentation skills0.6090.130.686***Self-regulation skills0.0470.054.110GPA0.0190.038.079Notes: 1R² = .662***, 2R² = .591***, 3R² = .597***; *p < .05, **p < .01, ***p < .001Discussion and conclusionsThe results on mathematical argumentation skills are in line with our hypothesis reflecting the results of studieson collaboration scripts for argumentation within other domains (e.g. Weinberger et al., 2010). Thus, learningwith a high structured collaboration script helped students extend their domain-specific skills in mathematicalargumentation. Since it was the high-structured script that led to better skill acquisition compared to the lowstructured script, the findings of this study are not favouring a strategy of minimal scripting when trying to avoidpossible overscripting (Dillenbourg, 2002). Furthermore, the difference between the high structured and the lowstructured script lies in the additional prompting for the use of Toulmin’s (1958) argument structure. The use ofthe structure itself might have helped student to elaborate more deeply on the mathematical content and throughthis they may have acquired better mathematical argumentation skills (King, 2007). It is plausible that increasinglymaking the script more complex would eventually lead to an overscripting (Dillenbourg, 2002). The moreimportant question than how much script support is necessary, might be which script support is actually helpful.Thus, a systematic variation of different script components based on different frameworks (Toulmin, 1958, Leitao,2002) might be a promising research direction for the future.As Vogel et al. (2014) point out, collaboration scripts rarely lead to domain-specific learning gain, if theyare not combined with adequate domain-specific instructional support. In a past study by Kollar et al. (2014),applying a collaboration script did not support the acquisition of mathematical argumentation skills substantiallybetter than unstructured collaboration, when combined with problem solving or heuristic worked examples. Theguided problem solving support using driving questions (Nadolski et al., 2006) based on an experts’ model of theproof process (Boero, 1999), as applied in this study, represents a compromise between the two approaches usedby Kollar et al. (2014). The results indicate that this approach might offer better opportunities for students toactually make use of the collaboration script support.The support with an adaptable collaboration script for argumentation was not significantly different fromleaning with a high-structured or a low-structured script regarding the acquisition of mathematical argumentationskills. Maybe the learners were overwhelmed with the task to adapt the collaboration script to their own needs.Further studies should investigate which kind of support would be necessary for students for being able to adaptthe collaboration script in a fruitful way. Also, computer support might be used to adapt the script automaticallyto the responses students give (e.g. Diziol, Walker, Rummel, & Koedinger, 2010).Furthermore, learners in the condition with the low-structured collaboration script reached higher scoresin the final mathematical argumentation skills test when they had good self-regulation skills. This implies thatespecially in the low-structured script condition, the learners with better self-regulation skills might have beenable to adjust their argumentation on a higher level than it was supported by the script and thus engage in moreelaborated learning dialogue, finally achieving better learning outcomes (King, 2007).ICLS 2016 Proceedings604© ISLSThe same effect could not be found in the other two conditions. This is especially surprising for theadaptable script condition. In this condition the learners were explicitly asked to adapt the learning environmentto their own needs. We expected that an adequate adaption of the learning environment would require a certainamount of self-regulation skills. Yet, there was no difference for students in the adaptable script condition withhigher or lower self-regulation skill in their acquisition of mathematical argumentation skills. One reason for thiscould be that all learners, no matter if they were good self-regulators or not, always adapted the script into onedirection without reflecting if this script might fit to their needs. Again, this is a further argument to find betterinstructions to help learners within the process of adapting their learning environments.What can be seen as success for the design of the collaboration scripts is the fact that in none of the threeconditions the GPA was an important factor for learning mathematical argumentation skills. The collaborationscript seems to “balance” to some extent the differences learners might have which might be expressed by theGPA the learners have.Of course, this study is not without limitations. What can be seen as drawback of this study is that it hasno real control condition in the sense of a waiting group or a group learning without any support. Yet, this studywas deliberately designed to compare different kinds of collaboration scripts which should lead to better insightsabout how collaboration scripts should be designed in order to support domain-specific learning.In conclusion, more structure seems to be better than less when we aim at designing collaboration scriptsto positively affect domain-specific learning outcomes. Mainly this might be true because less structure isaccompanied by higher demands on self-regulation skills which are quite unevenly distributed among secondaryschool students as well as freshmen at university.ReferencesAndriessen, J., Baker, M., & Suthers, D.
