Drawing on the ImplementingCollaborative Learning in the Classroom framework proposed by Kaendler, Wiedmann,Rummel and Spada (2014), the contributors to this symposium will speak to the way theirdesigns address the various parts of this framework, allowing us to draw conclusions aboutwhat has been successful for different parts of this process, and identifying future directionsfor development and research.Keywords: teachers, design issues, classroom technology, collaborative learningFocus of the symposiumAs the field of computer-supported collaborative learning embraces an ever-widening set of technologies, theopportunities to implement CSCL activities into classrooms increases, and the role of the teacher inorchestrating the learning experiences becomes a central concern. Moving away from standard personalcomputer and online activities, in favor of handheld devices, immersive simulations, large interactive surfaces,and device ecologies in classrooms allows for more face-to-face CSCL interactions in classrooms. These toolsprovide new opportunities to use the students’ interactions with the technology to provide insight into thecollaboration and learning processes, through the use of learning analytics. Thus, there is both the potential andthe need to design tools for teachers to use when orchestrating CSCL activities in their classroom (Dillenbourg& Jermann, 2010).The teacher’s role in supporting collaborative learning has received limited attention in the researchliterature (Webb, 2009), however, in a recent paper, Kaendler, Wiedmann, Rummel and Spada, (2014) proposea framework for teacher competencies in the implementation of collaborative learning in classrooms. Buildingon the premise that effective collaborative learning is largely dependent on the quality of student interactions,the framework focuses on teachers’ competencies in planning for, monitoring, supporting, consolidating andreflecting on these interactions. Three phases of activity are identified in the Implementing CollaborativeLearning in the Classroom (ICLC) framework. In the first phase, the pre-active phase, the teacher is involved inplanning the collaborative activity. In the second, the inter-active phase, the teacher focuses on monitoring,supporting and consolidating the collaboration, while students engage in collaborative, cognitive and metacognitive activities. During the final, post-active phase, teachers focus on reflecting on the activity andevaluating the student interactions in order to inform future activities. They propose that teachers draw on theirprofessional knowledge and beliefs to develop these competencies. This framework provides a useful startingplace for those involved in designing computer-supported collaborative learning activities for classrooms, as ithighlights the ways in which the teacher participates in these activities. This allows researchers to consider theCSCL 2015 Proceedings599© ISLSrange of opportunities for teacher engagement with collaborative activities, and design tools that supportteachers during the different stages or activities in this process.The major issues addressed and contribution of each presentationThe goal of this symposium is to bring together researchers who focus on computer-supported collaborativelearning in classrooms. Using their research and design work as it relates to the role of the teacher they willelaborate on the ICLC framework, identify areas for further development of the framework, and suggest how itcan be used to guide the design of orchestration tools. Two of the contributions focus directly on the design oftools to support teacher engagement during the inter-active phase of CSCL activities, providing initial examplesof the integration of technology into the orchestration process. Two focus on the actions of teachers duringCSCL activities in classrooms, developing our understanding of when and how teachers intervene at the smallgroup or whole class level, to inform future design decisions. The final three contributions focus on differentaspects of what teachers need in order to engage in the CSCL process, providing different lenses through whichto examine and extend the ICLC framework (fostering student interactions and teacher competencies withtechnology and collaborative learning pedagogy).In the first contribution, Martinez-Maldonado draws on research from the University of Sydney thatexamines how visual indicators can be used to help inform teachers about how students are interacting duringcollaborative tasks on multi-touch tables during the interactive phase of the ICLC framework. In a similar vein,Mercier’s contribution examines how providing teachers with updates about the content being created by groupmembers can be used by teachers to identify which groups or students need their attention.The contributions from both Fong and colleagues, and Joyce-Gibbons, pay attention to the way inwhich teachers orchestrate the whole-class interaction activities, during computer-supported collaborativelearning tasks. From these we draw a deeper understanding of the inter-active phases of the framework, and inparticular the informational needs of the teacher to help make decisions about when and how to intervene at thesmall group or whole class level.The final three contributions ask what the teacher needs in order to 1) support the students’ interactionbehaviors, 2) use technology effectively and 3) use collaborative learning effectively. The contribution fromIsrael looks at two important aspects of supporting CSCL – the preparation of students to participate incollaboration, and on-going interactions of teachers to align students with the expected collaborative interactionbehaviors. Using a framework to teach students about positive collaborative interactions developed by teachersin the research site, Israel reports on how it provides a basis for teachers to monitor and support students duringcollaborative processes. Forssell focuses on how to support teachers using technology – a key aspect ofimplementation. Drawing on survey data of practicing teachers, she identifies the prerequisite teacher beliefsand knowledge for adoption or adaptation of technology in the classroom. Finally, Shehab’s contribution drawson survey data from teachers who actively use collaborative learning, focusing on the key issues that theyidentify, in an effort to further elaborate the design requirements for tools to support orchestration of CSCL.SignificanceThis session will be organized as a structured poster session. Each contributor will take five minutes to describetheir work at the beginning of the session. The rest of the time will be equally divided between audienceengagement with the posters and an audience-wide discussion of future directions for this work. Rummel, anauthor of the ICLC framework, will provide commentary about the contributions and their relation to theframework at the beginning of the audience-wide discussion.The significance of this symposium will be in drawing out the specific design issues related to theICLC framework, informed by research that is actively addressing the role of teachers in CSCL classrooms. Itwill allow future development work to build on this framework, providing common terminology and a sharedunderstanding of the issues to facilitate comparisons or joint development work.Learning analytics and teachers’ awareness in the CSCL classroomRoberto Martinez-MaldonadoParts of the model addressed: Inter-active phase (monitoring and supporting).A particular recent strand of research carried out at The University of Sydney has focused on enhancingteacher’s awareness in a multi-tabletop CSCL Classroom: the MTClassroom (Martinez-Maldonado, 2014), bydeveloping and evaluating a series of awareness tools. By awareness tools we refer to those that provide a userCSCL 2015 Proceedings600© ISLS(e.g. the instructor) with an enhanced level of awareness of what other actors (e.g. students) are doing in thelearning space. This research has explored different ways to exploit student’s data that can be pervasivelycaptured through enriched multi-touch interactive tabletops to provide teachers with group indicators that cannotbe easily evaluated by teachers in the limited classroom time. This provision of visual indicators is stronglylinked to the field of Learning Analytics (LA) which has emerged in recent years as a multidisciplinary researcharea with the aim to improve the overall learning experience for instructors and students. This suggests thepotential value of the overlap between CSCL and the LA fields to provide novel and practical support in theclassroom.Part of the research studies in this project has included the exploration of real-time visualizations andnotifications that can suggest (or more directly alert) teachers about groups that may be facing problems(Martinez-Maldonado et al., 2014). Additionally, a number of data mining techniques has been applied to detectstudent’s behaviours that may not be collaborative and to identify the frequent patterns that are mostlyassociated with high or low achieving groups (Martinez-Maldonado, 2014). However, the most significantcontribution and recent contribution of the project is a proposed workflow to help other designers or researchersto more effectively design and deploy awareness tools for technology-enabled learning settings by following anUX-based iterative approach.Even though most of the work in this strand of research has addressed the inter-active phase of theICLC framework, work in progress is looking at the support that can be provided in design-time to teachers(pre-active phase) to design and re-design the learning tasks to be deployed in the classroom. Alternatively,further work is analyzing the ways in which similar learning analytics tools can be used by teachers to promotereflection after the classes have been enacted in the multi-tabletop classroom in order to drive re-design (postactive phase).Live content updates and teacher intervention in collaborative groupsEmma MercierParts of the model addressed: Inter-active (monitoring and supporting)The SynergyNet classroom was designed to allow teachers to manage the networked multi-touch tables from anumber of devices, including the shared display and a tablet. The teachers could send content to the tables, movecontent between the tables and shared display, freeze and clear the tables as necessary and, in some instances,view the work being conducted on the tables and change the parameters of the task. In this contribution, wefocus on the use of live updates to the teacher’s tablet during a collaborative math activity and ability to changethe task demands. This tool was developed in order to allow teachers to more easily assess the contributions ofeach individual student during the task.Building on a traditional classroom activity the tool NumberNet was designed to foster thedevelopment of mathematical adaptive expertise (Mercier & Higgins, 2013). During this activity, each groupreceives a target number, and each student works on their own number-pad to create expressions for thatnumber. The number-pad does not allow students to send duplicates to the table, but it does not reject incorrectexpressions. Groups work cooperatively or collaboratively to come up with as many correct expressions as theycan during a time limit. The teacher’s tablet receives live updates from the students, allowing her to see thecorrect (in green text) and incorrect (in red text) expressions each group or student is creating. In our studieswith this tool, the teachers used the live updates to 1) identify a student who was making the same mistakerepeatedly and intervene at the individual level; 2) identify groups who were relying on simple expressions andremove certain keys from the number-pad (e.g. the addition sign, the number 5) to make the task harder for thegroup; 3) identify a group who were struggling and pause the whole activity, using the shared display to conducta whole class discussion to help prompt the struggling group with new ideas.These tools allowed the teachers to make informed decisions about intervention at the student, group orwhole class level, altering the tasks and providing support as necessary. Although not explored in our studies,the tools also have the potential of being used in the post-active phase of the ICLC framework, where theteacher could use the information gathered during the task to prompt her reflections on the task and adapt thetask for future use. Additionally, when paired with tools that support the creation of tasks and allow teachers tomonitor the interaction of students, there is the potential to provide teachers with much needed insight into whento intervene at the various levels of learning that occur in the collaborative classroom.CSCL 2015 Proceedings601© ISLSThe 3R orchestration cycle: Fostering inquiry discourse in a CSCL classroomCresencia Fong, Rebecca Cober, Richard Messina, Tom Moher, Julia Murray, Ben Peebles and James D. SlottaParts of the model addressed: Inter-active (monitoring, supporting, consolidating)We observed exemplary inquiry teachers and found that they employed an orchestration “cycle” of ReflectRefocus-Release (3R) as a means of managing their CSCL classroom, over a 9-week astronomy unit for 2classes of grade 5/6 students. To support their inquiry, students used Common Knowledge (CK) – a notesharing tool that allows for “blended” (online and face-to-face) discourse (Fong, 2014). CK scaffolded studentsthrough 3 phases of collaborative astronomy inquiry: Brainstorm, Propose, and Investigate (Fong et al., 2013).Using tablets, students contributed to a community knowledge base that was represented in a public view on theinteractive whiteboard (IWB), which persistently and publicly visualized the community’s idea flow. Largedisplays were also created for student groups, on the side walls of the classroom, providing a visual mapping ofthe spatial distribution of inquiry topic specializations during the Investigate phase. Such public displaysenabled learners to sort ideas along socially negotiated categories. Inquiry work done in the CK environmentwas seen to influence the discourse in teacher-guided classroom discussions, and vice versa (Fong et al., 2014).Throughout the inter-active phase of the ICLC framework, teachers used these public knowledgevisualizations as formative assessment of the community’s knowledge state, to inform their monitoring ofcollaborative, cognitive, and metacognitive activity in the classroom. Students’ CK notes displayed on the IWBwere used by teachers to ground and spur face-to-face rounds of reflective classroom discourse, by whichteachers supported and guided their knowledge communities’ cognitive and metacognitive activity towardsknowledge consolidation, which often led to further inquiry trajectories. Such discourse usually culminated inteachers’ instructions that refocused the community’s subsequent inquiry and cognitive activity, scaffoldingstudents towards productive trajectories; at which point, students were released to pursue their inquirycollaboratively – resulting in further note contributions to the community knowledge base. This “3R” cyclefigured prominently in teachers’ orchestration of their enactments. Formative assessment of the community’spublicly displayed knowledge state informed teachers’ small-group interactions with students during Release,enabling them to provide timely support to students whom they deemed were in need. Reflective communitydiscourse was pivotal in helping students develop awareness of their community’s state of knowledge, achieveknowledge convergence, and receive teacher guidance towards productive inquiry.Content analysis of students’ CK notes examined their congruity with ideas that had emerged inprevious inquiry phases. The primary goal of such analyses was to determine if the collective inquiry wasprogressing, by uncovering the extent to which teachers’ Refocus statements were indeed driving students'inquiry progress, and to determine if CK was able to support the carriage and application of knowledge fromone inquiry phase to the next. Average scores for both classes were above 1.6 (out of maximum score of 3.0),suggesting that proposals (i.e. from the Propose phase) were somewhat inspired by direct reference toBrainstorm notes (i.e. from the Brainstorm phase), and Reports (i.e. from the Investigate phase) were influencedby the corresponding proposals to which they were linked.CK technology was designed to guide knowledge communities through a phased inquiry progressionwhile enabling students to drive their own inquiry trajectories. Its technology and script design assumed animportant role for the teacher, in the orchestration of the technology and inquiry activity. Future CK design willaim to decrease this teacher orchestration load – especially the monitoring of students’ collaborative andcognitive activity (i.e., during Release phase) in the inter-active phase of the ICLC, so that teachers could devotemore of their attention to supporting and consolidating students’ cognitive and metacognitive activity (duringRelease and Reflect). To this end, using technology to increase teachers’ awareness of the community’songoing state of knowledge, in terms of “where they are” and “where they are going”, can better equip teachersin their scaffolding of the community inquiry (i.e. Refocus).Exploring teacher behaviour prior to the initiation of mini-plenaries duringcollaborative group workAndrew Joyce-GibbonsParts of the model addressed: Inter-active (monitoring, supporting, consolidating)Classroom orchestration requires that teachers resolve a number of inherently contradictory imperatives(Dillenbourg, 2013). They must balance the need to maintain disciplinary norms, keep to time and manageCSCL 2015 Proceedings602© ISLSclassroom resources, with the need to stimulate dialogue (Perrotta & Evans, 2013). This study looked atteachers’ use of transitions from group-level interaction to whole-class interaction returning to group-levelinteraction in the context of these contradictory imperatives. Whilst such transitions are a common feature of ateacher’s repertoire, the orchestration tools developed by the SynergyNet project enabled a more rapid shift inregister, giving teachers the ability to freeze and unfreeze all tables simultaneously (Mercier et al. 2012).Two teachers working with 10 and 11 year-old children were observed prior to the initiation of ninetransitions. Each showed distinct behaviours in the minute prior to initiation of a transition. One teacherinteracted with a single group and then called the whole class together after observing issues that that group wasencountering, using the whole class discussion as a time to identify the issue and prevent all groups from goingdown the incorrect path. The other observed all groups silently for an extended period and then started aclassroom conversation based on a group who appeared to be working well, using their correct moves to modelthe appropriate problem solving activities to the class. These behaviours indicate the processes of reflexivejudgment by teachers that take place in the interaction phase of the ICLC framework.The teacher’s task as orchestrator of a CSCL activity is to continually balance progress being made bytheir students towards task completion, while engaging in deep collaborative discussion and knowledgeconvergence. Maintaining both sufficient progress for all groups in a classroom, and supporting all groups incollaborative knowledge building may represent a mini-ICLC cycle of pre- inter- and post-active phases withinthe lesson. Further research is needed to study this cyclical process by observing the impact of the transition ongroups of students once they resume their tasks.Further research is also needed to explore the collaboration management cycle and identify andevaluate the indicators that lead teachers to conclude that groups have deviated from the desired model ofinteraction sufficiently to warrant an intervention. A challenge for future CSCL classroom design is to provideteachers with a set of real-time indicators that enable them to make better-informed judgments as to thenecessity or direction of intervention.Supporting collaborative interactions during computing in K-5 classroomsMaya IsraelParts of the model addressed: Inter-active phase (monitoring and supporting).Computing education is spreading quickly with initiatives such as Code.org’s Hour of Code emerging. One ofthe advantages of computing technologies has been the focus on student collaboration and problem solving withpeers. In this way, students can engage in computational thinking and computational participation that results ina connected learning community (Kafai & Burke, 2014). Computing environments such as Scratch rely onhighly social processes in which students are encouraged to share their work with peers during the creationprocess. However, Good (2011) explained that despite the social aspects of these programming environments,we have yet to fully understand the types of collaboration that exist between learners and the types of benefitsthat students gain through these collaborative computing experiences.This contribution will highlight findings from a school-wide computing study that examined the use ofthe Collaborative Discussion Framework (Lash, Park, & Pitcher, 2014) for encouraging collaborativecomputing. The Collaborative Discussion Framework was created to help teachers facilitate collaborativeproblem solving during the computing process because although collaboration is widely discussed within thecomputing literature (Kafai & Burke, 2014), students often did not naturally collaborate effectively. Researchquestions included: (a) How do teachers promote collaboration within the context of computing instruction?And (b) How does teaching students how to collaborate influence their interactions and behaviors duringcollaborative problem solving? Data was collected through the Collaborative Computing ObservationInstrument (C-COI), in which students’ computing experiences were captured using Screencastify (an opensource screen capture software that also records audio). In this way, we could observe the on-screen behaviorsof the students as well as the conversations that they had while they completed computing tasks. The aim ofusing the C-COI was to measure how teachers promoted collaborative computing as well as the process ofcollaborative problem solving during difficult computing tasks. The C-COI was used to measure how teachersmonitored interactions among their students and facilitated collaborative problem solving, persistence, andpositive help seeking. The ICLC framework identifies the importance of students’ collaborative interactions, andthe teacher’s role in supporting these interactions throughout the three phases of the framework. This studyprovides insight into how teachers can prompt students to engage in particular forms of interaction anddiscussion and highlights the importance of proactive planning for collaborative discussions within the contextof CSCL instructional practices.CSCL 2015 Proceedings603© ISLSReady, Able, and Willing to Adopt CSCL PracticesKarin S. ForssellParts of the model addressed: Professional knowledge and teacher beliefsDesigning and implementing computer-supported collaborative learning activities requires teachers to learn newtools, new techniques, and new tasks. It requires both a pedagogical facility with collaborative activities, and anunderstanding of the technological tools that support them. In many studies of CSCL, the availability of thetechnologies, the teacher’s pedagogical competencies, and the willingness of teachers to engage in these tasksare taken as a given. This contribution seeks to 1) position the competencies identified in the ICLC frameworkin the broader context of the prerequisites for successful implementation of CSCL, and 2) explore what it mightmean to be willing and prepared to engage in CSCL activities.This study draws on data from a survey of accomplished secondary teachers in the US to examine therole of teacher competence in the adoption of new technologies and practices in classrooms. We make adistinction between being ready, able, and willing to use new tools. We define ready as self-perceivedcompetence. Able is represented by access to the required external resources. Willing is operationalized as abelief in the value of using computers with students. We explore these three constructs in relation to twooutcome variables: exploration of new computer-based activities with students, and frequent use of computers inthe classroom. Results suggest that the teacher’s self-perception of competence is the largest predictor of bothexploration and repeated use of new technologies. The external resources available, in this study represented bycomputers available in the classroom, play a large role in frequent use of technology, but are not a significantcontributor to exploration of new activities. Finally, beliefs about the value of technology in teaching and in thediscipline contribute to both frequent use and to exploration.We use these findings to explore what it would mean to prepare teachers to be ready, able, and willingto implement CSCL in their own classrooms. Specifically, we explore the important educational beliefs thatmotivate teachers' use of CSCL (Pajares, 1992). In our study, beliefs about the impact of technology in theclassroom are explored based on key elements of Pedagogical Content Knowledge (Magnusson, Krajcik, &Borko, 1999): knowledge and beliefs about curriculum, about students’ understanding of specific topics, aboutassessment, and about instructional strategies. For this contribution we explore beliefs inherent in the ICLCframework, and how they relate to the identified competencies. After exploring the application of these findingsto the ICLC framework, we suggest areas in which the framework provides important insights, and areas inwhich it could be extended.Teachers’ reflections on implementing collaborative learning in classroomsSaadeddine ShehabParts of the model addressed: Issues identified in Implementing Collaborative Learning in ClassroomsOne of the key features of the ICLC framework is an emphasis on the capacities that teachers bring to theclassroom when they orchestrate collaborative learning experiences. Understanding more about these capacities,and the issues that teachers encounter across the three phases of collaborative learning is essential to ourunderstanding of how to develop tools to support teachers during CSCL activities. Prior research has indicatedthat teachers identify issues related to time management and preparation of students to engage in collaboration(Gillies & Boyle, 2010) and issues relating to institutional norms, pedagogical practices and contextualconstraints of school systems (Ruys, Van Keer, & Aelterman, 2014). To further extend our understanding of theissues encountered by teachers who are actively using collaborative learning in their classrooms, we designed asurvey to explore the experiences of middle and high school science teachers using collaborative learning in oneUS state. The survey was completed by 69 middle and high school science teachers. For the purpose of thissymposium, we will report on teachers’ responses of three open-ended questions that aimed at exploring theirdefinitions of collaborative learning, their reasons for not using it, and their comments on its implementation.The open-ended answers were coded using an emergent coding scheme to identify the different themes thatemerged in the answers.When asked to define collaborative learning, teachers’ responses were coded into the categories:describing the purpose of collaboration, the interaction process, the outcome of collaboration, their roles asteachers, and the influence of the task. The majority of definitions included the first three codes but reflectedunderstandings of collaborative learning that was coded as naïve, moderate, or robust. Only one response wascoded as referencing the role of the teacher and the influence of the task. In response to a question asking forCSCL 2015 Proceedings604© ISLSreasons that they did not use collaborative learning the teachers listed reasons that are coded as related tostudents such as age and disciplinary problems and related to teachers such as stress, health, and lack ofresources. Other factors that were identified included time constraints and unequal participation of studentswhen working on collaborative tasks. In response to the open-ended item asking for any other comments aboutcollaboration, most responses were general positive or negative reactions to using collaborative learning orspecific issues that the teachers had encountered. A small number of responses were coded as relating to a needfor professional development, the role of technology in fostering collaborative learning, and a need to explicitlyaddress collaborative learning skills before, during, and after implementing it with students.These findings shed light on teachers’ understandings of collaborative learning, and the real orperceived barriers to the use of collaborative learning in classrooms. These provide an important understandingof real teachers, their experiences and competencies in implementing collaborative learning and possible areasfor intervention and development. The responses identified the issues such as time management, resources andoutcomes or assessment issues, as well as needing to prepare students to engage in collaboration and participateequally. Drawing on the ICLC framework, there are a number of design opportunities at each phase that couldbe implemented to allow teachers to more easily design, monitor and assess collaborative learning and CSCLactivities in their classrooms. In the design of CSCL tools, identifying the problems encountered by teachersensures that the tools created provide useful solutions that ease the issues related to orchestrating collaborativelearning in classrooms.ReferencesDillenbourg, P., & Jermann, P.
