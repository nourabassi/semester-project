We introduceddigital storytelling so that student teachers could visualize their prospective internships andcould then engage in a dialogue related to teachers’ professional socialization and identitydevelopment. A social network analysis (SNA) showed a relatively stable impact of prospectivestorytelling on the online dialogue that structurally demonstrated teachers’ professional valuesand social behaviors, rather than focusing solely on their teaching.IntroductionA student teacher’s experience with a particular school’s institutional and ecological aspects is the strongestdeterminant of one’s teaching outlook (Fenstermacher 1980). Practicum can function as a factor in developingprofessional identities and increasing socialization through an intensive working experience. Sharing andexamining such working experience in schools is essential for student teachers to effectively develop theirprofessional identity and increase professional socialization. Our research indicated that a weblog communitywith an experienced teacher during the practicum could be an excellent resource for professional socialization byallowing the student teachers to exchange practical knowledge, impressions of their respective workingenvironments, and solutions to various problems.The purpose of the current study is to investigate the conditions necessary to create a weblog communitywhere the student teachers could discuss the variety of work-related experiences they encountered during theirinternships with the goal of increasing teachers’ professional socialization and building their professional identity.Storytelling can be another means to represent the teachers’ professional identity and socialization, that isconstructed in their life stories as workers in the school (Atkinson and Delamont 1985). This study examines thepotential benefits of digital story telling (DST) wherein the student teachers share their prospective experiencesto obtain a broader understanding of schools as workplaces, with improvement in the quality of online dialoguein the weblog community from the viewpoint of professional socialization.Research designA design-based research methodology was applied for five years in an on-campus course as a part of a Japaneseundergraduate teacher training program requiring a two to three-week practice teaching internship at a school(Table 1). The student teachers were asked to access the weblog community and post a weblog on their workingexperience every 2 or 3 days throughout the internship, as well as to comment on weblog entries of other studentteachers. DST was implemented from the 3rd year, just before the practicum began. Each student teacher made apresentation using their prospective working stories created with a cartooning application before their practicum.The student teachers could foster their professional socialization and identity development by imagining potentialscenarios (including relationships with key individuals and cultural artifacts).Table 1: Overview of the participants, weblog activities, and interventions.1# ofStudentTeachers152982366 (430)34571688211841180 (221)125 (326)51 (93)YearICLS 2018 Proceedings# ofWeblogs# ofComments102155 (355)An Experienced Teacher’s Participation as aFacilitator on the Weblog CommunityOnline only, actively providing commentsOnline (inactive) and face-to-face (with insightfulcomments)Providing comments and asking questions both onlineand face-to-face from a professional teacher’sperspective1403DSTNoNoYes© ISLSNote: Numbers in parentheses include the professional’s facilitations and comments.Weblogs and comments were coded for ascertaining to what extent the student teachers wrote about working asschoolteachers, and whether they took the school’s institutional characteristics into consideration. The codingscheme was based on Hong (2010), including (1) Commitment Towards Work, (2) Value and Standpoint asTeachers, (3) Emotion, (4) Micropolitics, (5) Efficacy, and (6) Knowledge and Beliefs of Teaching, as well as (7)Expectations and the Reality of Schools, (8) Social Behavior as Professionals, and (9) miscellaneous category.When a weblog or a comment entry had multiple categories, each category was counted; coding discrepancieswere resolved through discussion. Furthermore, to evaluate the quality of online dialogue during each academicyear regarding discourse structure, a social network analysis was conducted using Knowledge Building DiscourseExplorer (Oshima, Oshima, and Matsuzawa 2012). We focused on degree centralities of each coded categoryrelated to teacher socialization and professional identity development to assess temporal structural qualitiesindicating the linkage of the categories pertaining to such development.Results and discussionFigure 1 shows differences in transitional changes of the sum of degree centralities and each category’s degreecentrality related to teacher socialization and identity development, focusing on values and standpoints, and onsocial behavior as professionals. The graphs showed a tendency for transitions in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th years tohave a relatively higher stable value when compared to the 1st and 2nd years, indicating that the student teachers’discourse concentrated densely on teacher professional socialization. One-way ANOVAwith Bonferroni post hocanalysis for 5 factors (years) with the sum of degree centrality as the dependent variable revealed that each sumof degree centralities for the 3rd (n = 303, M = 5.02, SD = .995), 4th (n = 446, M = 4.69, SD = 1.15), and 5th (n =136, M = 4.68, SD = 1.12) years was significantly higher than those for the 1st (n = 457, M = 2.89, SD = .947)and 2nd (n = 512, M = 3.63, SD = 1.52) years; F (4, 1849) = 214.103, η p 2 = .317, p < .001.Similar one-way ANOVAs with Bonferroni post hoc analyses using the degree centrality for eachcategory as the dependent variable revealed that the indicators of “Value and Standpoint” for the 3rd (M = .595,SD = .258), 4th (M = .576, SD = .214), and 5th (M = .562, SD = .274) years were significantly higher than thosefor the 1st (M = .270, SD = .235) and 2nd (M = .364, SD = .297) years; F (4, 1849) = 129.316, η p 2 = .219, p <.001, with Bonferroni post hoc analysis. Moreover, the indicators of “Social Behavior” for the 3rd (M = .762, SD= .121), 4th (M = .691, SD = .175), and 5th (M = .756, SD = .189) years were significantly higher than those ofthe 1st (M = .512, SD = .209) and 2nd (M = .554, SD = .265), even though there were significant differencesbetween the 4th and 3rd/5th years; F (4, 1849) = 107.387, η p 2 = .189, p < .001.This indicates that the third-year design comprising storytelling about the student teachers’ prospectivework experiences fostered structured dialogue from the viewpoint of teachers’ professional socialization.Figure 1.
