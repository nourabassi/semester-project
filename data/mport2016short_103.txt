The present study explored how college students’ onlinecollaborative inquiry activities may inform their epistemic views. A mixed-method analysisrevealed that students’ online knowledge-building and inquiry activities were associated withthe change of their epistemic views. When engaging in more productive group inquiry activities,a more sophisticated epistemic view conducive to continual idea improvement for knowledgeadvancement was more likely to develop among students.IntroductionThe demand for new knowledge and novel ideas to solve existing and emerging societal problems is increasing(Csikszentmihalyi & Wolfe, 2014; Drucker, 2011). Because ideas are essential for knowledge-creating andproblem-solving and human beings are naturally capable of idea generation, it has become increasingly moreimportant for educators to think about how to foster students’ creative competency to generate and work creativelywith ideas (Koh, Chai, Wong, & Hong, 2015). The educational challenge for knowledge innovation or creation,in particular, is how to maintain sustained effort for the improvement of ideas (Scardamalia & Bereiter, 2003;2006). Traditional educational approaches tend to emphasize the importance of acquiring and accumulatingknowledge from textbooks and instructors, while neglecting the more innovative part of transforming studentsinto knowledge workers who can produce and improve ideas for their knowledge work (Scardamalia & Bereiter,2015). Papert (2000) refers this educational phenomenon as “idea aversion” (i.e., dislike of ideas), and he furtherargues that typical learning environments are less likely to help students produce and work with their own ideas.Instead, they are designed for direct instruction for teachers (cf. Sawyer, 2004; 2011). Ideas initiated by studentsare treated with little value and are not much appreciated (unlike textbook knowledge that are favoured in mostlearning environments).Accordingly, students not encouraged either to dedicate themselves to pursue andmaterialize their ideas for the sake for knowledge advancement. To address this concern, the present studyengaged students in the process of continual production and improvement of ideas.Epistemological views concerning idea-centered knowledge workThe important role ideas played in a knowledge-intensive society may be best explained by Popper’s (1972) threeworld epistemology. Popper postulates three different forms of ontological reality to explain how the threeepistemic worlds come into being. The three epistemic worlds are: (1) the natural/physical world (World 1), (2)the psychological world (World 2), and (3) the humanly-constructed conceptual world (World 3). In brief, World1 refers to natural or physical reality, and can exist by itself with no human presence. World 2 considers reality asa mental state created in the human mind. It is a private world consisting of a person’s personal thoughts andfeelings, and the experiences of his or her perceptions and interpretations of World 1. In contrast, World 3conceives reality as being constructed by man-made “ideas” as conceptual artefacts; these in turn give form to allother humanly-constructed, materialistic artefacts that further substantiate the existence of World 1. Popperespecially highlights the important contribution of World 3 to human civilization that is caused by humans’exceptional imaginary capacity to work with and act upon ideas—ideas that are readily existent or emergent—and to transform them into feasible solutions and accepted knowledge for solving problems. Unfortunately, asargued by Bereiter (2002), traditional school education tends to value change in a student’s mind-as-a-containerin World 2 (e.g., by delivering knowledge from authoritative sources such as textbooks and teachers to the student),but neglect the importance of initiating students into a World 3, idea-centered, knowledge-building culture. Thequestion of how to transform a World 2-oriented education that highlights knowledge acquisition into a World 3oriented knowledge-building education remains an open pedagogical challenge.Knowledge building pedagogyKnowledge building is defined as a collaborative process that is focused on continuous work with ideas of valueto a community (Scardamalia & Bereiter, 2006). Knowledge building can be characterized by three distinctivepedagogical design features: it is idea-centred, principle-based, and community-focused. First, building onICLS 2016 Proceedings787© ISLSPopper’s (1972) epistemological framing of World 3, knowledge building emphasizes the value and importanceof ideas as epistemic entities for human knowledge construction, and considers idea improvement to be at thecentre of all learning activities. Second, knowledge building employs a principle-based--rather than a procedurebased--pedagogical design to ensure the sustained improvement of ideas (Zhang, Hong, Scardamalia, Teo, &Morley, 2011). This design is very different from a highly structured, procedure-based instructional design forguiding classroom practices (Reigeluth, 2013). A pre-specified procedural design usually prescribes classroomactivities in advance. Teachers are sometimes even required to carry out their instruction using certain teachingscripts (see Sawyer, 2004). In contrast, a principle-based approach only employs a number of guiding pedagogicalprinciples to ensure maximum flexibility so that students can work adaptively with their self-generated ideas. Forexample, the knowledge-building principle of “idea diversity” highlights the fact that diversified ideas areessential to sustained knowledge advancement, “…just as biodiversity is essential to the success of an ecosystem.To understand an idea is to understand the ideas that surround it, including those that stand in contrast to it. Ideadiversity creates a rich environment for ideas to evolve into new and more refined forms” (Scardamalia, 2002, p.79). Third, knowledge building highlights community-oriented, rather than individual-oriented, knowledgepractice. While ideas must be generated by individuals, continuous improvement of ideas relies on a wholecommunity’s collaborative effort. In particular, the quantity and quality of the ideas being enriched and refinedare highly dependent on the effectiveness of social interactions in the community. Given the importance offostering students’ capacity to produce and work innovatively with ideas for knowledge work, the present studyattempts to investigate (1) whether sustained idea improvement in a knowledge-building environment is relatedto a more constructivist-oriented, idea-centered World 3 epistemic view that is essential for creative knowledgework, and (2) whether the development of a constructivist-oriented, World 3 epistemic view is related to onlinecollaborative inquiry activities.MethodThe participants in this study were 41 undergraduate students from a national university in Taiwan. The coursewas offered by the teacher-education program in the university to students who planned to teach about naturesciences and living technologies at primary schools after they graduate from university. The university is rankedas one of the top 10 universities in the nation. Over the past few years, supported by a grant from the nation’sMinistry of Education, the university has been deeply dedicated to improving its course quality, with a reformpreference toward transforming traditionally more didactic modes of teaching into more constructivist-orientedteaching practices. This reform movement created an opportunity for KB theory and technology to be introducedinto this course as an alternative method of teaching and learning. The ages of the participants in this course rangedfrom 18 to 20. The duration of this course was 18 weeks.The duration of the course was one semester. The main goal of the course was to help students developa better understanding of the role of ideas in knowledge creation. To this end, they were guided to engage in theknowledge-building process, and as a learning outcome they were required to design some living technologyproducts that could be used to enhance the quality of people’s daily lives. To facilitate student learning,knowledge-building principles (e.g., “idea diversity”, as discussed above) were employed to enable cycles ofprogressive idea improvement.A pre-post survey on students’ epistemic views, focusing on the nature of ideas and using the followingopen-ended questions, was employed: What are “ideas”? What are the criteria for a good idea? Why? Where doideas come from? Can ideas be improved? If so, why can they be improved and how can they be improved? Ifnot, why could they not be improved? As shown in Table 1, a coding scheme was developed, using Popper’s(1972) conceptual framework of a three-world epistemology, to score students’ responses to the above questions(Strauss & Corbin, 1990). If a response matched with a given coding category of an epistemic view (i.e., a World2 or World 3 view), one point was given, with the maximum number of points for each of the two epistemic viewsbeing three. Inter-coder reliability, using the kappa coefficient, was computed as 0.90. In addition, participants’interaction patterns in the Knowledge Forum were analysed to provide a basic understanding of participants’online behaviour and learning processes (e.g., the average number of notes contributed, read, built on, etc.). Ttests were conducted to compare the differences between World 2 and World 3 epistemic views to see whetherthere is any change in students’ views over time after they engaged in knowledge practice for a semester.Table 1.

(S02)An idea is a kind of abstract thought producedfrom thinking. (S19)Ideas are one’s personal points of view aboutsomething. (S10)Ideas can help improve one’s intelligence.(S23)ResultsEpistemic viewAs Table 2 shows, in the pre-survey, the participants’ understanding of the nature of ideas was quite limited, astheir epistemic view scores (i.e., 0.62 for World 2 views and 0.73 for World 3 views; all three aspects combined)were way below the average (which is 1.5, with the maximum score being 3.0). Moreover, Table 3 also showsthat there were no significant differences between students’ World 2 and World 3 views in any of the three aspects.In the post-test, it was found that there was a change in students’ World 3 views, as their epistemic view score forthe World 3 view increased from 0.73 to 1.67 (with all three aspects combined), while their World 2 views ofideas remained very much the same. This suggests that, after working collaboratively with ideas for a semester,students became more aware of the important role of ideas as epistemic entities for sustained knowledge creation.In particular, there were significant increases in the scores for each of the three coding aspects of the World 3epistemic view. The participants tended to see that: (1) ideas can be treated not merely as abstract concepts, butas concrete objects that can be tinkered with and modified; (2) ideas can be derived not just from reflectivethinking within one’s mind-as-a-container, but from interaction with the physical world (e.g., by interacting withthe environment); and (3) not only can ideas be used for personal knowledge growth, but they can becollaboratively and innovatively improved to advance community knowledge. Overall, the findings suggest thatstudents started to develop a more informed World 3 epistemic sense that is critical for collaborative knowledgebuilding.Table 2.

They usually began this process by identifying authentic problems derived from their personal lifeexperience (M=13.90, SD=9.17 for the mean number of problems identified). They then moved on to produceinitial ideas of how to address their problems of interest by posting notes online (M=27.49, SD=18.80 for themean number of notes contributed). To diversify their ideas, they read and/or built on one another’s notes(M=397.85, SD=225.67 for the mean number of notes read; and M=20.83, SD=18.75 for the mean number ofbuilt-on notes). In the meantime, to facilitate idea search and exchange for diversification, they marked keywordswithin notes (M=18.22, SD=15.06 for the mean number of notes that contained keywords). To reflect on andimprove the ideas further, they tried to build on, annotate and/or revise one another’s notes (M=8.15, SD=9.65 forthe mean number of annotations; M= 4.22, SD= 4.02 for the mean number of revisions). They also usedcustomizable scaffolds to facilitate the inquiry process (M= 22.41, SD=21.09 for the mean number of scaffoldICLS 2016 Proceedings789© ISLSsupports), with the purpose of integrating ideas for the eventual improvement of their technology products. Allthe online activity measures were found to be significantly correlated with one another (.60 < r <.99, p < .01),suggesting that the more actively the participants were engaged in one online inquiry activity, the more likely theywere to engage in another activity as well.Moreover, the learning groups in this course were formed based on individual interest in self-identifiedtechnology problems. To examine differences in group performance, the average score (M=6.90, SD=3.87) ofstudents’ epistemic views obtained in the pre-post survey was used as a separation point to divide the groups intomore-informed groups (with higher scores) and less-informed groups (with lower scores). As a result, it was foundthat there was a significant difference in terms of epistemic scores between the more-informed groups and theless-informed groups (F(1, 39) = 6.19, p < .05). Further analysis of online performance was conducted, and it wasfound that the more-informed groups were more active, and engaged more, than the less-informed groups in allaspects of online activities except for the reading activity. However, none of the differences were statisticallysignificant. But, when the length of inquiry for each group was counted and then compared, it was found that therewas a significant difference between the more-informed and the less-informed groups (F(1, 39) = 4.17, p < .05),indicating that a longer inquiry time seemed to contribute to higher epistemic view scores.DiscussionTo sum up, knowledge-building pedagogy, with a focus on sustained idea improvement, seemed to be useful as ameans to help students develop an informed World 3 epistemic view for knowledge advancement. However, ifstudents only focus on lower-level idea exchange and sharing activities for knowledge building, their epistemicviews may not change much. One important thing to note is that there was still room for students in even morewell-informed groups to enhance their high-level inquiry skills in order to become more effective knowledgebuilders. Further studies will look into this to help us to identify more effective instructional know-how.ReferencesBereiter, C. (1994). Constructivism, socioculturalism, and Popper's World 3.
