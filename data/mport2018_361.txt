We studied 250 children, aged 8-16, ina quasi-experimental design. Results indicate the exhibit did not have a major impact inchildren’s perceptions of who engineers are but did positively impact what they knew aboutwhat engineers do as part of their job.Keyword: Engineering, Lego, Informal Learning, MuseumsIntroductionMany children have little exposure to engineering and may not have access to the subject in their school. Informalscience institutions can help fill in the gap by creating engineering curriculum and exhibits (Engineering isElementary, 2017). This study is about one such exhibit that incorporates engineering curriculum with a popularchildhood toy: Lego bricks. Our guiding research question was, “What is the impact of visiting the exhibit onguest awareness of the roles and identities of engineers, designers, architects and builders?”Literature reviewThere is a current need to increase the number of students prepared for careers in science, technology, engineering,and math (STEM) (U.S. Department of Education, 2015). Previous research suggests that students do not have astrong awareness of what engineers do and conceptualize them mainly with fixing, building, and working onthings (Capobianco, Dux, Mena, & Weller, 2011; Cunningham, Lachapelle, & Lindgren-Streicher, 2005).Informal science experiences can improve science understanding and increase participation in scientific activitiesand awareness of scientific careers (Bell, Lewenstein, Shouse, & Feder 2009; Banks et al., 2007). But despite agrowing number of engineering-based museum exhibitions, there is little research on the impact theseopportunities have on visitors’ understanding of engineering careers.MethodsWe collected data through guest assessments. Families with children 8-16 were recruited as they passed a commonarea near the exhibit entrance and exit. Those who had previously attended the exhibit were grouped into thetreatment condition, while those that had not yet attended were placed in the control group. While the childrencompleted their assessments, the parents completed a demographic background survey. One hundred and thirtyguests were recruited into the treatment condition and 120 in the control. The overall gender distribution was 54%male and 46% female. The mean age was 10 (1.9 SD). The top three self-identified racial groups were White(84%), Asian (8%), and African American (5%). About 12% identified as Hispanic.The child assessment consisted of two sections. The first was modeled after the Draw an Engineer (DAE)instrument that asked children to draw an engineer at work and write a short description of what they are doing(Knight & Cunningham, 2004). The second assessment was based on the What is an Engineer (WIE) instrument(Cunningham, Lachapelle, & Lindgren-Streicher, 2005). The WIE consists of 16 icons that show someone atwork, with a small description below them. The child is asked to circle the icons that represents engineers at work.Drawings from the DAE instrument were analyzed by researchers using the rubric described by Weber,Duncan, Dyehouse, Strobel, & Diefes-Dux (2011). The rubric utilizes 24 items to encapsulate the different aspectsof each of the drawings. T-tests reveal the ‘train’ and ‘fixing’ variables were the only significant differencesbetween the control and treatment. For the WIE instrument we found differences between the conditions on 6 ofthe 16 icons, significance was tested using independent samples t-tests (Table 1).Table 1: “What is an Engineer”“What is an Engineer?” InstrumentICLS 2018 Proceedings1497© ISLSEngineering TaskIcon Label(Y/N)TreatmentControlRead about Inventions*Y.42.28Design Ways to Clean Water**Y.52.32Work as a Team***Y.78.57Test Things***Y.67.42Repair CarsN.59.69Design Things***Y.85.67Clean Teeth*N.08.02Note. Percentages reflect number of responses that circled the icon. Each icon had an image with the label beneath it.ConclusionResults suggest that the exhibit was successful in increasing awareness of roles an engineer but did not stronglyimpact their conceptions of who engineers are. Using the rubric, the DAE only had 2 differences in drawingsbetween the control and treatment, “train” and “fixing”, in both cases the control group drew these items morefrequently. This ties into other studies finding strong associations between engineers and trains when using theDAE (Capobianco, Diefex-Dux, Mena, & Weller, 2011; Knight & Cunningham, 2004; Fralick, Kearn, Thompson,& Lyons, 2009; Karatas, Micklos, & Bodner, 2011). In those studies, it is generally thought that trains arecommonly drawn due to the term engineer being used to describe train crew. However, the WIE had significantdifferences in 6 icons (Table 1). All but one of these categories are aligned with what an engineer would do intheir job. Not surprisingly, the exhibit provides opportunities for children to take part in activities related to thesecategories. This study provides evidence about strengths and limitations for using an exhibit-based informallearning space to introduce children to engineers.ReferencesBanks, J., Au, K. H., Ball, A.
