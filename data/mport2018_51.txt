Experts' Goals and Constraints When Discussing Vaccines WithLaypeople on a Facebook GroupAviv J. Sharon, Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, a.sharon@technion.ac.ilAyelet Baram-Tsabari, Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, ayelet@technion.ac.ilAbstract: Science education and science communication scholars have dedicatedconsiderable attention to the fact that laypeople must rely on experts to make decisions ineveryday life. Direct communication between experts and non-experts has been facilitated bysocial media. However, little attention has been given to the processes and outcomes of thesecommunication events, and particularly, to the goals and constraints of the experts. Here, wecharacterize experts' considerations for answering science- and health-related questions on aquestions-and-answers (Q&A) Facebook group dedicated to vaccines. Results indicate thatexperts have a diverse set of goals and constraints, including disseminating knowledge,defending science and calming fears. Constraints include maintaining collegiality andavoiding provision of medical advice. In light of the findings, we propose a concept ofexperts' "bounded engagement with the public."IntroductionRecently, the scholarly community has dedicated increasing attention to the ways science literacy (SL)manifests itself in everyday life. SL has been loosely defined as the knowledge useful or valuable forindividuals "using science in their lives, interacting with science information, and making decisions related toscience" (National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine, 2016, p. 3), and as a property ofcommunities and societies as well. Since individuals have a necessarily "bounded understanding of science"(Bromme & Goldman, 2014, p. 60), they must rely on scientific experts, such as scientists and healthcareprofessionals, to cope with the demands of everyday life in a technologically advanced society.Based on several strands of evidence, Feinstein (2011) has characterized SL as the ability to "interactwith sources of scientific expertise in ways that help [one] achieve [one's] own goals" (p. 180). He also assertedthat this is necessarily done from an "outsider's" perspective. Using similar reasoning, scholars have proposedthat science education must focus on teaching students how to be intellectually dependent on "insider" expertsand how to integrate scientific knowledge when they face a specific practical problem, such as a personal healthdilemma or a community's environmental concern (e.g., Aikenhead, 2006; Norris, 1995; Weeth Feinstein, Allen,& Jenkins, 2013).The sparse research on the usefulness of science literacy in everyday life has focused on layperspectives, such as those of elderly people planning their heating budgets (Layton, Jenkins, Macgill, & Davey,1993), or those of parents of children with special needs, such as Down's syndrome (Layton et al., 1993), autism(Weeth Feinstein, 2014) or hearing impairments (Shauli & Baram-Tsabari, 2016). By contrast, less is knownabout the expert side of lay-expert interactions, science-related or otherwise, especially in online environments,such as social media platforms and questions-and-answers (Q&A) services (Brossard & Scheufele, 2013; Shah,Oh, & Oh, 2009; Stilgoe, Lock, & Wilsdon, 2014). Moreover, existing studies on lay interactions with expertshave focused on collective contexts of shared policymaking, while non-policy-related dialogue has remained"under-theorized and under-researched" (Davies, McCallie, Simonsson, Lehr, & Duensing, 2009, p. 338). Thisdialogue can promote learning among both experts and laypeople, in the social constructivist and socio-culturalsenses of the word (Davies, McCallie, Simonsson, Lehr, & Duensing, 2009).Hence, in this study, we explore dialogue on a controversial, everyday personal health issue in anonline community of scientific experts and non-experts, from the perspective of scientific insiders. This is partof a larger study, which will incorporate experiences of non-expert "outsiders" as well. Specifically, wecharacterize the considerations guiding participation of experts in science and health in a Q&A Facebook groupdedicated to vaccines.Literature reviewPublic communication of scientific experts and health professionals with laypeopleScientific experts often view their public communication as a one-way transmission of knowledge, meant toeducate knowledge-deficient publics to various ends, e.g., to assuage fears of new technologies (Burchell, 2015;Simis, Madden, Cacciatore, & Yeo, 2016). For example, in Cook, Pieri and Robbins (2004), scientistsICLS 2018 Proceedings416© ISLSdeveloping genetically modified crops justified this technology by communicating about it within a narrowevidentiary perspective, rather than including ethical or political perspectives. Accordingly, they focused theircommunication efforts on simplifying scientific information for non-expert audiences. This perception is in linewith the "deficit" model of science communication, which views public lack of scientific knowledge as thecause of disagreements on socio-scientific topics (Trench, 2008). Deficit-model thinking tends to guide mostexpert communication of science online as well. In the USA, a survey among members of the AmericanAssociation for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) found that respondents typically prioritized "deficit-like"goals higher than "dialogue-like" goals for their public communication online (Dudo & Besley, 2016).Similarly, Chinese scientists who communicate publicly about science online prefer delivering lectures overpublic dialogue on controversial topics, to avoid trouble with their institutions and to avoid offending otherscientists (Jia, Wang, Miao, & Zhu, 2017). Additionally, English-speaking science bloggers tend to perceivetheir communication roles primarily as "explainers" and "civic educators" rather than "conveners" who connectscientists with non-scientists (Jarreau, 2015).By contrast, some scientists favor a two-way, more symmetrical exchange, especially in policymakingcontexts (Burchell, 2015; Simis et al., 2016). These perceptions are in line with the "dialogue" and"participation" models of science communication (Trench, 2008). For example, in Burchell, Franklin andHolden (2009), 30 UK biomedical scientists with experience in public engagement were reported to perceivemembers of the public as legitimate and capable interlocutors in policy debates relating to science and health.In health contexts, there is limited research on online dialogue between laypeople and health providersin public settings, such as online health communities. Instead, most research focuses on interactions amongpatients (Vennik, Adams, Faber, & Putters, 2014). However, several case studies provide a glimpse into someexpert perspectives of online communication with laypeople. Firstly, health professionals participating in aSlovenian online health community noted that they enjoyed sharing medical knowledge and dispellingmisconceptions and stigmas about diseases, yet they also reported difficulties managing ethical aspects, andoften felt overloaded by the number and complexity of questions (Atanasova, Kamin, & Petrič, 2017).Secondly, a content analysis of a Dutch infertility forum showed that health professionals often respond topatients' informational questions and utterances reflecting concern (Aarts et al., 2015). In the USA, experts onWebMD online health communities typically provide askers with clinical expertise (90% of answers), referthem to their doctors (16.7% of answers) and attempt to build rapport with them in various ways, includingexpressing empathy and encouragement (5.8% of answers) (Huh, McDonald, Hartzler, & Pratt, 2013).Overall, the available evidence has an important implication for science literacy: Even though 72% ofU.S. internet users report seeking health information online (Pew Research Center, 2013) and 87% reportseeking scientific information online (Pew Research Center, 2006), there is little evidence that scientific expertsor health professionals routinely try to attend to lay authentic needs and desires in their public communication.Hence, there is little evidence that laypeople have opportunities to interact directly with such experts online andco-construct knowledge with them.Motivations and objectives of answerers on online Q&A servicesSeveral aspects of Q&A services, such as Quora and Yahoo! Answers, have been studied, including the types ofquestions asked by asker demographics (Baram-Tsabari, Sethi, Bry, & Yarden, 2006), asker motivations(Morris, Teevan, & Panovich, 2010) and answer quality (Harper, Raban, Rafaeli, & Konstan, 2008). However,few studies have explored Q&A services from the answerer's perspective (Oh, 2012; Shah et al., 2009). Theexisting studies on answerers are mostly based on questionnaires and user activity data. On Yahoo! Answers,answerers who produced health-related content reported that their main motivations were altruism, enjoymentand a sense of efficacy (Oh, 2012). Harper et al. (2008) observed that in at least one case, a large, activecommunity of both researchers and volunteer users contributed to the quantity and quality of answers.Quantitative data on a Chinese social Q&A service, such as following accounts and "upvotes", suggest thatanswerers were motivated by peer recognition and social learning (Jin, Li, Zhong, & Zhai, 2015). Additionally,several correlations were found between reported motivations and reported answering strategies. For example,questionnaire data suggests that answerers motivated by efficacy tend to select difficult questions, and alearning motivation correlates with searching for additional information when creating answers (Oh, 2011).Vaccine hesitancyWe chose to investigate public communication of scientific experts in the context of the public controversysurrounding vaccines, because of the pervasiveness of the phenomenon: Health authorities recommend that allchildren be vaccinated against several infectious diseases, with only rare exceptions. Health authorities regardroutine childhood vaccines as a safe and effective way to prevent and even eradicate disease, yet "[a]t the needleICLS 2018 Proceedings417© ISLSpoint, [vaccination] enters the intense social world in which parents and carers seek to help their childrenflourish" (Leach & Fairhead, 2007, p. 2). Although vaccination coverage rates are high in high-incomecountries, many parents in these countries hesitate to vaccinate children under their care. In fact, 17% of adultsin the World Health Organization's European region consider vaccines unsafe, compared with 13% worldwide(Larson et al., 2016). "Vaccine hesitancy" is a complex decision-making process, that depends, among othervariables, on trust in health authorities and in mainstream medicine (Peretti-Watel, Ward, Schulz, Verger, &Larson, 2015). Although scholars have recognized the potential of social media for vaccine promotion(Stockwell & Fiks, 2013; Wilson, Atkinson, & Deeks, 2014), few studies have documented vaccine-relateddiscourse online. While there is some research on question topics sent to expert-based Q&A services (GarcíaBasteiro et al., 2012) and of online discussions about vaccines (Fadda, Allam, & Schulz, 2015; Nicholson &Leask, 2012), none of these studies focused on scientific experts' participation in these discussions. A contentanalysis of the Israeli Facebook group "Parents Talk about the Polio Vaccine" indicated that experts tended tobase their claims on ideas relating to the nature of science and to methods of scientific inquiry more often thannon-experts. Additionally, claims, even those made by experts, were seldom supported by evidence (Orr &Baram-Tsabari, 2017; Orr, Baram-Tsabari, & Landsman, 2016).Research questionWhat considerations guide experts' participation in health and science in a vaccine-related Q&A group on socialmedia?Research fieldWe conducted this study on the Hebrew-language Facebook group Medabbrim Al H̱issunim ("Talking aboutVaccines"; hereafter TaV), founded in October 2013. TaV had over 28,000 members in October 2017. On thegroup, askers may pose vaccine-related questions and receive answers from community members at no cost.Most askers are mothers of infants. Answerers are often, but not always, experts in science and medicine,including physicians, nurses and scientists, as well as physicians-in-training and scientists-in-training. A list ofexpert names and professional titles is available through the group description. According to group rules, nonexperts in science and medicine are permitted to answer too, but only if their answers reflect "the evidencebased scientific consensus." Some non-expert answerers are very active as well. Hence, the group can beconsidered a hybrid between a "community-based" Q&A service and an "expert-based" Q&A service (Shah,2017). TaV has a "public" privacy setting, meaning that its content is visible to non-members. It is operated by asmall, volunteer-based Israeli non-profit organization named MiDa'at (derived from the Hebrew term HaskamaMiDa'at, "informed consent"). The organization advocates compliance with the vaccination schedulerecommended by national public health officials. MiDa'at and TaV were founded in the wake of Israel's 2013Polio crisis, continuing and expanding the activity which took place in a previously established pro-vaccineFacebook group, described in Rubin et al. (2016), Orr et al. (2016) and Orr et al. (2017).MethodologyInterviews were conducted with ten TaV answerers as part of a larger multiple case study. Two were physicians;one specialized in family medicine and the other was a pediatrician. Another answerer was a physician-intraining. Two answerers were nurses, and five had completed graduate-level research training in biological ormedical sciences, or were currently in such training (Table 1). Snowball sampling was used, with "snowballcriteria" of being an expert in science or health with at least six months' experience answering questions on thegroup.Table 1: Demographic details of interviewees1.2.3.4.5.6.7.PseudonymGenderProfessional BackgroundDanHilaMatanVeredYokhiMa'ayanShlomoManWomanManWomanWomanWomanManPhysician-in-trainingPh.D. student in a biological/medical fieldPhysicianNursePhysicianNursePh.D. in a biological/medical fieldICLS 2018 Proceedings418Interview Length(Minutes)105374839746937© ISLS8.

The first part of the interview was a semi-structured interview focusing on the interviewee'smotivations for participating in TaV and on their perceptions of askers. Some questions were: "In your opinion,what prompts askers to ask questions in the group?" and "How do you think that askers decide whether to trustyou?". The second part was a modified "stimulated recall interview" (Lyle, 2003; Shubert & Meredith, 2015),which can also be considered a modified "reconstruction interview" (Reich & Barnoy, 2016). In this part, studyparticipants were given print-outs of five to six TaV threads they had participated in during the 6 monthspreceding the interview. They were then asked to read each print-out and explain how they interpreted eachquestion and what considerations they had when composing their answer(s). Interviews were conducted at theparticipants' homes, workplaces or universities, at each one's preference. The interview with Hila wastranscribed by the first author and all others were transcribed by a professional service. All transcripts werecoded inductively in MAXQDA by the first author. Approval was obtained from the authors' institutionalreview board (approval number 2016 – 19) and from the MiDa'at board of directors.ResultsExperts used a diverse set of considerations in their online communication about vaccines. Goals includeddisseminating knowledge about the vaccines and the diseases they help prevent, defending science againstunfounded rumors and conspiracy theories, and calming fears of parents. At the same time, answerers weremindful of two salient constraints: maintaining collegiality with their health professional peers and avoidingprovision of medical advice for individuals, even though askers' questions are often phrased in individual terms(Table 2).Table 2: Goals and constraints of TaV expertsThemeDisseminatingknowledge(Goal)PrevalenceHighDefendingscience (Goal)MediumCalming fears(Goal)MediumICLS 2018 ProceedingsExample quote"[The mother] asked, 'does a two- or three-week delay in the vaccinesfor four-month-olds hurt the efficacy of the vaccine in any way'. Ianswered that there was no problem at all in terms of efficacy. Theonly consequences had to do with delaying the protection thatvaccines give." (Hila)"I wrote that one of the rumors that annoyed me the most […] wasabout immunological memory. […] People keep saying as if it were afact: 'Infants have no immunological memory. Obviously.' And that'sso wrong. It's so easy to disprove." (Hila)In response to a mother who asked whether MMRV, a live attenuatedvaccine, provided only community immunity, rather than protectingthe vaccinated child. The mother asked the same question in an antivax Facebook group: "So I took this mix-up that she made and madea snide remark: Pay attention to the people giving you answerselsewhere. 'Whoever told you that […] doesn't know what they'retalking about. Really, I suggest you always ask whoever's giving youanswers about their education and training and what they're basingtheir answer upon.'" (Dan)In response to a mother who observed her child talking less often, andsuspected that vaccination caused a decline in language development:"I started from the point: 'You did the right thing.' Because she wrotethat she may have done damage with the vaccine. 'On the contrary,you did the right thing. You protected your child. Vaccines havenothing to do with language development.'" (Dan)"A lot of the time, [if askers are in emotional turmoil] I don't answer.I let [other] parents respond from their perspective as parents. And if Ido, many times I say: 'Look, I'm doing a PhD in [a biomedical field –419© ISLSMaintainingcollegiality(Constraint)MediumAvoidingprovision ofmedical advice(Constraint)Mediumredacted], I took many classes, I read a lot of papers and I vaccinatemy children.' Sometimes that helps too. It reassures." (Hila)"If there's a measles outbreak [in Europe] and people say, 'the nursewouldn't give a vaccine,' you know, I [maintain] collegial[ity] to the[staff of the] well-baby clinics. […] I give the rationale and why weact the way we do, and what the rules say and who guides us."(Vered)"Someone I know who lives in [town – redacted] asked a question [onTaV] about a vaccine for her one-year-old child, who had a very verylong fever, and we sent her to a doctor and the doctor told her things.[…] I was tempted to ask who the doctor was who told her thisnonsense, because he said it was from the vaccine even though thechild had sores in the mouth and all the signs of foot and mouthdisease, that can cause a really long fever, but it clearly wasn't anadverse reaction to the vaccine. […SO WHAT DID YOU DO?]Nothing. […] It's none of my business. I need to let her professionalsdo their work even if I think they're wrong." (Yokhi)"Somebody once told me – one of our supervisors here [at the wellbaby clinic] – 'Be careful when you answer [on TaV] because theycan sue you. So that made me think more, because, in fact, I don'tgive individual answers anymore. […] I don’t give individual advice,I write my answer more generally." (Vered)DiscussionExperts exhibit a complex set of goals and constraints in their communication with askers on TaV. In someways, findings evoke previous research on public communication of science by scientific experts, but in otherways, they diverge from the literature. For example, answerers report taking a defensive stance against anti-vaxactivists, like the "defending science" motivation reported by many scientists communicating online. On theother hand, they exhibit a caring and nurturing form of science communication, offering health information andsocial support for vaccine hesitant parents who specifically ask for it. TaV can be considered a community foron-demand dissemination of scientific information. This communication is a modified form of the deficit model,characterized by being guided by the publics' genuine information needs. This, arguably, makes it more"legitimate" than other dissemination activities (Trench, 2008, p. 130), which have been characterized as "topdown," "hierarchical," "linear, pedagogical and paternalistic" (Bucchi & Trench, 2014, pp. 3-4).However, the constraints also deserve further reflection. Just as there is discussion of publics' "boundedunderstanding of science" (Bromme & Goldman, 2014), we propose to introduce the concept of experts'"bounded engagement with the public". Even the most well-intentioned experts are bounded by their ownknowledge (including knowledge of the askers' specific context) and by social constraints, such as therelationships that experts must maintain with their peers.Further research on co-construction of scientific and health knowledge in online communities can takeseveral directions. Firstly, whether answerers achieve their goals vis-à-vis askers remains to be examinedempirically through research with askers. Do dissemination efforts result in knowledge gains? Do answerers'efforts to calm askers truly work? Secondly, further research could characterize the competencies needed forexperts for meaningful dialogue with laypeople. Do experts learn these competencies "on the job" or do theydraw on skills learned beforehand? To what extent can these competencies be taught, and what are someeffective ways to do so? Thirdly, the concept of experts' "bounded engagement with the public" raises questionsabout the nature of that engagement. What kind of lay questions do experts think they can reasonably answer,and how does that compare with laypeople's expectations? Research into these questions can advanceunderstanding of science literacy on the community level, both within technologically-enhanced environmentsand outside of them. It can also advance the understanding of co-construction of knowledge in onlinecommunities.ReferencesAarts, J. W. M., van Oers, A. M., Faber, M. J., Cohlen, B. J., Nelen, W. L. D. M., Kremer, J.
