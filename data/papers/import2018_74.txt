Moreover, such work often analyzes the direct impact of dyadic features likerapport on learning, without considering the role played by individual factors, such aslearners’ prior knowledge and self-efficacy. In this paper, we investigate the intertwinedimpact that rapport, self-efficacy, and prior knowledge have on the process and outcomes ofpeer tutoring. We find that peer tutors in high-rapport dyads offer more help and prompt theirtutees to explain their reasoning more than low-rapport dyads, with tutees in such dyadsverbalizing their problem-solving process and proposing more steps and answers. Meanwhile,rapport is associated with increased procedural performance, but tutees’ self-efficacy and priorknowledge moderate the effect of rapport on tutees’ conceptual performance.IntroductionAs decades of scholars have argued, learning is a socially-mediated process, embedded in relationships betweenstudents and their teacher, and between students and their peers. The interpersonal components of classroomtalk - those focused on building and maintaining social relationships - are inextricably intertwined with theinteractional process of providing feedback, hints, and instructions (Wentzel, 1999; Parr and Townsend, 2002;Madaio et al., 2017). Though teachers and schools may primarily promote educational goals, students arrive inthe classroom with relational goals, which may include developing relationships and friendships with each other(Wentzel, 1999). They also arrive with individual resources for and attitudes towards learning that may impactthe ways that they establish and respond to both the educational and social environment of learning. Priorresearch has particularly targeted reciprocal peer tutoring as a form of learning likely to result in learning gainsdue to relational factors (Parr and Townsend, 1992; Webb and Mastergeorge, 2003). As students are asked tolearn in increasingly collaborative learning environments, and as one of the most touted 21st century job skills isthe ability to collaborate, it is important to understand whether and how the rapport learners build with oneanother impacts learning. Specifically, there remain questions about how the social bond among studentsintersects with the individual resources and beliefs of each student to impact the process and outcomes of peertutoring.Educational technologies are increasingly designed to mediate students’ collaborative learning(Carmien et al., 2007), or to take on the role of a teacher or peer. In prior work, we have treated the question ofhow the social relationships between peers in collaborative learning (here, peer tutoring) impact learninggains. Here we ask how rapport's impact on learning gains might be mediated by the student's own academicability and beliefs about learning (which we operationalize here as self-efficacy; Pajares, 1996). We have arguedthat rapport is a phenomenon that must be understood – and designed for – as taking place over time (Zhao etal., 2014). For that reason, in this paper we look not just at learning gains, but also at the process-orientedmechanisms by which social factors interact with individual cognitive and socio-cognitive factors to influencethe peer tutoring process. Specifically, in this work we investigate how rapport between peer tutor and tuteeinfluences the learning-related behaviors that each participant engages in, moderated by tutees’ prior knowledgeand self-efficacy. We contribute to the larger learning science community by (1) Shedding light on how theimpact of social factors like rapport on learning is moderated by individual cognitive and socio-cognitive factorslike prior knowledge and self-efficacy, respectively; (2) Identifying the core sequences of tutor and tuteebehaviors associated with moments of high and low rapport, to shed light on the peer tutoring process as it playsout over time; and (3) Teasing apart the intertwined influences of rapport, self-efficacy, and prior knowledge ontutors’ help-provision and tutees’ verbalization of problem-solving.Related workRapport has been described as a “harmonious, coordinated interaction based in mutual attention, respect,understanding, and openness”, characterized in learning interactions by nurturance on the part of a teacher andICLS 2018 Proceedings600© ISLSincreased engagement in classroom activities on the part of students (Wentzel et al., 1999). However, in contrastto prior work on teacher-student rapport, the impact of student-student rapport on peer learning interactions hasbeen less well-studied. Work in our own lab suggests that rapport is beneficial for learning outcomes in peertutoring settings (Zhao et al., 2014; Sinha and Cassell, 2015), but that work did not look at whether or howindividual factors mediated the impact of rapport on learning processes. Work on differences in learningdynamics between dyads of friends and non-friends (often a proxy for rapport) found that learning interactionsbetween friends are characterized by a warm, supportive climate favorable to exploration and problem-solving,a more elaborated learning discourse, and greater expectations for assistance and support from the other,(Wentzel, 1999), as well as greater tolerance for direct challenges and differences of opinion (Azmitia andMontgomery, 1993). Prior work suggests that the supportive climate engendered by relational closeness mayconstitute a motivational support that mitigates anxieties around self-explanations, help-seeking, and problemsolving attempts, encouraging more participation and engagement in learning (Wentzel, 1999). However, thesefindings were based on groups of self-defined friends, which may mask a great deal of variation in the nature orduration of those friendships. To unpack these nuances, we focus on students who have never met before.From the tutor’s perspective, prior work suggests that more capable peer tutors support their partners’needs for “positive face”, or desire to be approved of by others (Brown and Levinson, 1987), particularly whenthey lack the relational closeness of friendship or rapport (Madaio et al., 2017). Peer tutors may do this bymodifying the behaviors that may threaten the other’s face, such as overly direct instructions or knowledgemonitoring, while increasing “face-boosting” behaviors, such as positive feedback. Other work has argued thatclose, “integrative” social relationships among peers are characterized by greater resource provision (Wentzel1999) and unsolicited advice- or help-giving, which may be perceived as face-threatening without a sufficientrelationship (Feng and Magen, 2013). However, prior work suggests that tutors’ provision of the correct step oranswer to a problem without providing deeper conceptual support may be not only unhelpful, but may actuallybe harmful for tutees’ learning (Webb and Mastergeorge, 2003). The best tutors, therefore, prompt their studentsto provide elaborated explanations of the concepts and reasoning either through explicitly requestingexplanations or by prompting them with leading questions (Webb and Mastergeorge, 2003).While this work demonstrates that relational closeness has a positive influence on students’participation and engagement in learning, other prior work has uncovered competing influences at work:namely, students’ self-efficacy, or their beliefs in their ability to successfully complete a task, and their priorknowledge (Webb and Mastergeorge, 2003; Wentzel, 2016). Students with lower self-efficacy or priorknowledge may be more likely to avoid publicly engaging in the problem-solving process by verbalizing fewerself-explanations and attempts of the problems, due to fears of judgment or negative evaluations from theirpeers (Wentzel, 1999), which may conflict with the motivating influence of rapport. Such students might notonly be reluctant to attempt the problems for fear of failure but, worse, they might engage in what Newman(2002) describes as “nonadaptive” or “dependency-oriented” help-seeking, or, help requests designed to elicitthe answer from a partner to avoid the risk of failing. Therefore, it is critical to understand how the helpprovided by peer tutors is influenced by their rapport with their tutees, and how tutees’ responses to tutors’ helpare influenced by their rapport with their partner, their self-efficacy and their prior knowledge.In sum, prior work argues that interpersonal closeness between tutor and tutee is likely to lead toincreased tutor helping behaviors and increased tutee engagement in the learning process. However the nature ofthat interpersonal closeness has primarily been treated as a dichotomous measure of friendship, which maymask variation in the nature and strength of those friendships. We thus investigate the rapport establishedbetween strangers, to identify how peers without an existing relationship negotiate between their relational andtheir task goals. Further, prior work suggests that learners’ self-efficacy and prior knowledge may moderate thepathway from social support to improved learning outcomes (Wentzel, 2016), but it leaves open the question ofhow rapport, self-efficacy, and prior knowledge interact to impact tutoring processes and learning outcomes.This leads us to investigate the following research questions:RQ1: To what extent does the rapport between peer tutors and their tutees, when they first begin theirrelationship, interact with those tutees’ prior knowledge and self-efficacy to impact their learningoutcomes?RQ2: How does the rapport between peer tutoring dyads impact the learning process, as it plays outover time?RQ3: To what extent does the rapport between newly formed tutoring dyads interact with tutees’ priorknowledge and self-efficacy to impact tutees’ help-seeking and self-explanations, and tutors’ helpprovision?ICLS 2018 Proceedings601© ISLSMethodologyData corpus and dialogue annotationsThe corpus described here was collected as part of a larger research program on the effects of rapport-buildingon reciprocal peer tutoring. Participants were assigned to 20 dyads that alternated tutoring one another in linearalgebra equation solving for two hour-long sessions, a week apart. though data from only 15 dyads were usabledue to issues with recording, participant retention, or a pre-existing relationship between partners, for a total of~30 hours of data. Each session was structured such that students engaged in two brief periods of getting toknow one another interleaved with two longer periods of tutoring, where each student was randomly assigned tobe the tutor for one of the tutoring periods in each session. The peer tutor was not assumed to have any greaterprior knowledge than their partner for the problems they were tutoring them on and, as such, all tutors wereprovided with instructions on how to teach the problems for which they were assigned the role of tutor.The students took a pre-test before the first session and a post-test after the final session to assess theirprior knowledge and their learning gains. Both tests included procedural (problem-solving) and conceptualitems (multiple choice items on algebraic concepts). The participants (mean age = 14.3, min=13, max=16) cameto a lab on an American university campus in a mid-sized city for the study. Half were male and half female,assigned to same-gender dyads, so that, as in other work with this corpus, any gendered differences in the social,rapport-building behaviors of the participants could be identified. To control the baseline level of interpersonalcloseness, we paired students with a partner they had not met before (and removed two dyads that we laterdiscovered to have already met), similar to the dyads of “strangers” in Madaio et al., (2017). Audio and videowere recorded, and audio transcribed and segmented into clauses. Participants were provided with survey itemsto assess their self-efficacy for algebra, following (Pajares et al., 1996), and their perceptions of the rapport inthe dyad. As part of a larger research program on the relationship between rapport and peer tutoring, this corpuswas annotated for a set of social, rapport-building verbal and nonverbal behaviors, following Zhao et al., (2014),and for a set of tutoring and learning behaviors, following Madaio et al. (2016)’s work on knowledge-telling,knowledge-building, procedural and conceptual questions (though here we additionally annotated for subtypesof each of those categories, as shown in Table 1, with Krippendorff’s alpha for all categories > 0.75). In thispaper, we describe analyses of behaviors likely to be impacted by relational closeness: two types of tutorbehaviors: tutors’ help-offering and explanation-prompts; and five types of tutee behaviors: tutees’ helprequests, answer-checking, step-level procedures, answers-proposed; and evidence-based reasoning.Table 1: Tutoring and Learning Strategies AnnotatedRoleTutorTutorBothStudentStudentStudentStudentLow-Level StrategyHelp-OfferingExplanation PromptingState Step-Level ProceduresGeneral Help RequestsAnswer CheckingAnswer ProposingExplain ReasoningAbbreviationHOEPSPHRACAPERExample“Let me know if you need any help with this one”“Why did you say to divide it by 5?”“Ok so I’m gonna add three to both sides here.”“Wait, how do I do this kind again?”“Is that right?”“I think x is 7.”“I divided by 5 because it needs to be reduced.”Rapport ratingRapport between dyad participants was evaluated using a “thin-slice” approach (Ambady and Rosenthal, 1992),where the corpus was divided into 30-second video slices provided to naive, third-party raters, following Sinha& Cassell (2015) where three raters rated the rapport in each slice on a Likert scale from 1-7, and a single ratingwas chosen for each slice using a bias-corrected weighted majority vote approach. From the 120 30-secondslices in each session, we calculated a summary rapport score for each session, the “utopy” (Sinha, 2016), whichwe use in this paper as our rapport measure. Prior work has shown that statistical summaries such as a measureof central tendency or proportion of high and low ratings of rapport collapse the temporal dimension and are notas robust as more stochastic-based models which capture the evolution of rapport over time (Sinha, 2016). Wethus fit a Markov chain of order 1 to the sequence of 120 rapport ratings for each session, and used the resultingtransition probability matrix to generate a measure of the “utopy”, or likelihood of the dyad being in a highrapport state, which is the sum of each transition probability weighted by the distance of the transition (e.g.rapport 2 to 5) (Madaio et al., 2017; Sinha, 2016).Sequence mining and clusteringICLS 2018 Proceedings602© ISLSTo better understand how the rapport between tutor and tutee impacts the tutoring and learning process overtime, we adopt a sequence mining approach. We used the USpan algorithm to mine “high-utility” sequentialpatterns, where “utility” in this case is the rapport value of the thin-slice window in which a given behavioralsequence occurred (Fournier-Viger et al., 2016). However, most sequential pattern mining algorithms producelarge outputs with many similar patterns that make interpretation of the resulting sequences difficult. To resolvethis, we developed a sequence summarization approach, based on Patel et al.’s sequence clustering technique(Patel et al., 2017). A directed weighted graph was constructed to represent a set of sequences as a cluster, witheach annotated behavior represented by a node, and the number of times each multiple-node behavior sequenceoccurred represented by the weights of the edges, similar to (Patel et al., 2017). We differ from Patel et al. bythen summarizing each sequence cluster into a single “core sequence” which reflects the most representativebehavior sequences for that cluster. For each graph, we first simplify the result by removing unrepresentativeedges (those with very small weights). We then identify the “core sequence” of each sequence cluster, definedas the longest simple path between any two nodes on the graph to find the most common sequences.FindingsWe first wanted to validate our use of the “utopy” measure of rapport, or, the likelihood that rapport will beincreasing from one “slice” to the next, by understanding its relationship to students’ self-reported rapport at theend of each session. Prior work has found a significant correlation between “thin-slice” observer judgments ofinterpersonal rapport and participants’ own self-report (Grahe and Bernieri, 1999). Our data replicates thatfinding, showing a significant positive correlation between the “utopy” measure of rapport for each dyad andthat dyad’s average self-report rapport rating (ρ = 0.49, p<.005). Other summary measures of the thin-slicerapport data, such as the average value for each dyad, did not, following Sinha’s (2016) finding that utopy was amore informative measure of temporally dynamic interpersonal constructs such as rapport than simple measuresof central tendency such as the average. For the following analyses, all results are significant after correcting formultiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg post-hoc correction (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).Rapport and learning outcomesWe first investigated research question (RQ1): how tutor-tutee rapport interacts with tutees’ self-efficacy andprior knowledge to predict tutees’ learning outcomes. Since prior work suggests that students with lower priorknowledge and self-efficacy will reap the most benefits from the socially supportive environment engenderedby rapport (Wentzel, 2016),. we hypothesized that students with lower prior knowledge and self-efficacy willdemonstrate greater performance at post-test when they have increasing rapport with their tutors (i.e. highutopy). In order to identify interactions between tutees’ prior knowledge (operationalized by their score on apre-test) and their rapport, we used the post-test performance as the dependent variable rather than a normalizedlearning gain score. We ran two hierarchical linear mixed-effects models, with two measures of tutees’ post-testperformance (procedural items and conceptual items) as the respective dependent variables, and interactionsbetween tutees’ pre-test percent, their self-reported self-efficacy, and their rapport utopy measure as fixedeffects, with random effects for session and dyad. Significant results are reported in Table 2.Table 2: Coefficients of regressions for pre-test, rapport, and self-efficacy on procedural and conceptual itemsPost-test Item TypePre-testSelfEfficacyProcedural0.47***0.28***Conceptual0.67***RapportRapport*Pre-testRapport*Self-efficacy0.40***0.10*-0.25 **Rapport*Pre-test*Self-efficacy0.19 **p<0.05*, p<0.01**, p<0.001***For the model with the procedural post-test items only, rapport was only predictive while interactingwith prior knowledge and with self-efficacy. In those two two-way interactions, while tutees in high-rapportdyads did demonstrate greater procedural performance over tutees in low-rapport dyads, unexpectedly, thetutees with high-rapport with their tutors that also had greater prior knowledge and greater self-efficacyperformed better than their low prior knowledge and low self-efficacy peers on the post-test items. That is,contrary to our hypothesis, tutees that already came to the session with greater prior knowledge and greater selfefficacy benefited the most on procedural test items from having high rapport with their tutors.ICLS 2018 Proceedings603© ISLSThe conceptual post-test performance tells a different story, however. There was a two-way interactionbetween rapport and self-efficacy, and a three-way interaction between rapport, self-efficacy, and priorknowledge. In the three-way interaction, the tutees with low prior-knowledge and low self-efficacydemonstrated greater conceptual performance when they had high rapport with their tutor, in line with ourhypothesis that students who needed the most support would benefit from rapport (Wentzel, 2016).Unexpectedly, however, tutees with low prior-knowledge and high self-efficacy demonstrated worse conceptualperformance when they had high rapport with their tutor. This same pattern was true for the two-way interactionbetween rapport and self-efficacy as well. That is, when tutees with lower self-efficacy had increasing rapportwith their tutor, they were more likely to have higher conceptual post-test scores, but when tutees with greaterself-efficacy had higher rapport with their tutor, their conceptual post-test scores were more likely to be lower.Unfolding processes over time: Core sequences for high and low rapportTo understand how the rapport between tutor and tutee impacted their respective contributions to theintertwined, dyadic process of tutoring and learning (not just the learning outcomes on the post-test), weconducted a sequence mining and clustering analysis to identify the most common sequences of tutoring andlearning behaviors. We will discuss here the most commonly occurring “core sequences” of dyadic behaviorsassociated with high-rapport and low-rapport values in the 30-second “thin-slice” windows (RQ2).The core behavioral sequence cluster associated with high rapport (rapport values above 4), whichoccurred a total of 151 times in our corpus (out of a possible 834 sequences), contained the behavioral sequence{Tutee States Procedures, Tutee Explains Reasoning, Tutor Help-Offering}. That is, the tutee first verbalizedsome step-level procedure, then explained their reasoning for doing so, and only then did the tutor offer to help.Such a process is characterized by self-explanations from the tutee and the subsequent provision of help offeredby the tutor, as in Wentzel (1999). One example of this from our corpus is the tutee saying, “Wait, so it’s k plusk plus two” (SP), then “Cause I need to get all the k’s on one side” (ER), followed by the tutor, “Does it makesense what you need to do after that?” (HO). It is significant that we see this order to the sequence, rather thanthe opposite: tutors offering help prior to the tutee attempting the problem, (which was not one of the coresequences associated with high rapport), as that sort of anticipatory help-offering may imply a lack ofconfidence on the part of the tutor for the tutees’ ability to solve the problem on their own, rather than offeringsupport after the tutee attempts to solve it first (Webb and Mastergeorge, 2003).The core behavior sequence associated with low rapport (rapport values below 4), which occurred 268times in our corpus, contained the behavior sequence {Tutee Proposes Answer, Tutee Checks Answer, TutorStates Procedure, Tutee States Procedure}. That is, we see a problem-solving process characterized by tuteesproposing an answer, requesting confirmation of the correctness of that answer, and then the tutor providing thenext step, which is then stated by the tutee. In our corpus, one instance of this is the tutee saying, “y is equal tonegative five” (AP), “Is that right?” (AC), and the tutor responds with “Try adding the 10 to both sides instead.”(SP), followed by the tutee: “Ok, so ten plus five is fifteen.” (SP). Here, the tutee is explicitly requesting thehelp or feedback that may instead be provided by the tutor unsolicited if they had greater rapport between them.This also suggests the type of nonadaptive, dependency-oriented help-seeking described by Webb andMastergeorge (2003), where the tutee requests feedback and validation throughout the problem-solving processthat they may not need, rather than trusting in their ability to solve the problems or in their tutor to provide help.Impact of rapport on tutoring and learning behaviorsGiven the surprising impact on learning outcomes from the interaction between rapport and individual tuteefactors (prior knowledge and self-efficacy) in RQ1, we wanted to understand how those factors jointly impactedeach individual tutee and tutor behavior, to complement our sequential analysis of those intertwined behaviors(RQ2). Specifically, we wanted to understand how dyadic rapport interacts with tutees’ self-efficacy and priorknowledge to influence tutees’ learning strategies (i.e. self-explanations and help-seeking behaviors) and tutors’instructional behaviors (i.e. help-offering and explanation-prompting). We hypothesized (RQ3a) that tutors willdo more explanation-prompting and help-offering when rapport is increasing, based on prior work that suggeststhat friendship, or a social relationship, allows for the kinds of probing questions (Azmitia and Montgomery1993) and unsolicited advice-giving (Feng and Magen, 2013) that might be seen as face-threatening without thatrelationship. We also hypothesized (RQ3b) that tutees with lower prior-knowledge and lower self-efficacy willgenerally request help and check their answers more often in dyads with high rapport, based on prior work thatsuggests that students’ willingness to seek help may be inhibited without a sufficient social relationship withpeers (Newman, 2002). We also hypothesized that tutees in high-rapport dyads will verbalize their problemsolving more readily than in low-rapport dyads, particularly those with greater self-efficacy, following priorwork suggesting that friends (a proxy for high-rapport) are more likely to take risks in learning due to a reducedICLS 2018 Proceedings604© ISLSfear of failure (Azmitia and Montgomery, 1993), and prior work in peer tutoring that found that tutees who werefriends with their tutors engaged in more “knowledge-telling” (Madaio et al., 2016).To investigate these hypotheses, we ran a set of hierarchical linear models with the frequency of tutorand tutee behaviors of interest in each session as the dependent variables, normalized by their total utterances,and with tutors’ and tutees’ pre-test percent, their self-efficacy, and the rapport utopy score for that session asthe fixed effects, with interaction terms, and with random effects for session and dyad. We ran these models fortutors’ help-offering (HO) and explanation prompting (EP), as well as tutees’ stated procedures (SP), answerproposing (AP), generic help-seeking (HS), answer-checking (AC), and explanations of reasoning (ER) as theDVs for each model. We report significant results from the models in Table 3.Table 3: Coefficients of regressions for pre-test, rapport, and self-efficacy on tutoring and learning strategiesTutoring and LearningStrategiesTutorTutee.Tutees’Pre-testHelp OfferingExplanation Prompting-0.43**General Help RequestsAnswer CheckingAnswer ProposingStating ProceduresExplain Reasoning-0.31*-0.38**SelfEfficacyRapportRapport*Pre-testPre-test*Self-efficacy0.33*0.37*0.43**-0.36**0.45**0.40*-0.40**-0.30*-0.23 .-0.56***p<0.10, p<0.05*, p<0.01**, p<0.001***For the tutors’ help-offering and explanation-prompting, as we hypothesized, when in sessions withrising rapport (utopy), tutors prompt their tutees for explanations of their reasoning more often (e.g. “wait, whywould it be two?”) and offer more help to their tutees (e.g. “do you want to see my work?”). This aligns withresults from the high-rapport sequences mined. Tutors also offer help more often when tutees’ prior knowledgeis low, suggesting that peer tutors not only recognize when help is needed (i.e. when their tutees have low priorknowledge), but they are also influenced in their help provision by the rapport they have with their tutee.For tutees, low prior-knowledge tutees use general help requests (e.g. “wait where do I even start?”)more often than high prior-knowledge, as was hypothesized, with no effect of rapport or self-efficacy. Similarly,for tutees’ answer-checking (e.g. “is it nineteen over six?”), tutees with lower prior knowledge check answerssignificantly more than those with greater prior knowledge. Contrary to our hypothesis about rapport motivatingmore help-seeking, tutees with higher rapport ask their tutors to check their answers significantly less than thosewith lower rapport with their tutors, which was also seen in the low-rapport sequences mined in RQ2. It may bethe case that, given the supportive environment of high rapport, these tutees did not feel the need to explicitlyrequest the help that was freely offered in those high-rapport dyads. Surprisingly, tutees with low priorknowledge and higher self-efficacy answer-check significantly more than tutees with both low prior-knowledgeand low self-efficacy. This increased use of explicit confirmation of answers suggests a dependency-orientedapproach to help-seeking exhibited by low prior knowledge tutees, particularly when those tutees also have highself-efficacy, aligning with our findings from RQ1. This also aligns with Williams and Takaku’s (2011) findingthat middle-school students with high self-efficacy, despite their low performance, engaged mostly in nonadaptive help-seeking, which included seeking help when not needed.For tutees’ answers proposed (e.g. “p equals 23”), tutees in high-rapport dyads are proposing moreanswers than those in low-rapport dyads, which may be explained by the reduced apprehension of criticalfeedback in a socially-supportive environment engendered by rapport. Interestingly, low prior knowledgestudents with high self-efficacy proposed more answers than all others. That is, these students who haveconfidence in their algebra ability, despite their low performance on the pre-test are both proposing moreanswers, and asking for confirmation of those answers (as seen in the previous result). For the tutees’ statedprocedures (e.g. “I think I should add thirteen”), high rapport is associated with more verbalizing of theirproblem-solving procedures, as hypothesized. For the low prior knowledge tutees, those in high rapport dyadsverbalize their problem-solving procedures significantly more than those with low rapport. This aligns with ourICLS 2018 Proceedings605© ISLShypothesis that students with less prior knowledge who might otherwise feel apprehensive about verbalizingtheir problem-solving process are more likely to do so when they have greater rapport with their tutor. Similarly,for the explanations of reasoning (e.g. “I’m gonna divide cause I’m trying to cancel out”), low prior knowledgetutees in high-rapport dyads explain their reasoning more than those with low-rapport.These results suggest that rapport contributes to a supportive climate for learning where help from thetutor is provided more readily and tutees feel encouraged to verbalize their problem-solving process. However,for students whose confidence in their abilities outstrips their actual performance, the increased verbalization ofthe problem-solving process may contribute to their use of a more dependency-oriented, nonadaptive helpseeking process. While this may lead to improved procedural performance, without engaging in elaboratedexplanatory discourse, this may cause them to miss opportunities to improve their conceptual understanding.DiscussionDesigners of learning environments, technological or otherwise, are always designing –whether they are awareof it or not –for learners who are imbricated in webs of socio-cognitive relations with other learners, thinkingand learning in partnership with other learners and with the technologies they use. Therefore, if designers oflearning environments are attempting to intervene to improve the learning process, they must first understandthe nature of the existing socio-cognitive processes at work. Carmien et al., (2007) have argued that the“scripts” introduced by collaborative support tools may conflict with the internal “scripts” that studentsthemselves already bring to bear on the collaborative learning process. Prior work suggests that the rapportbetween teachers and students or between peers benefits learners by creating a warm, socially-supportivelearning environment (Wentzel, 1999), while other work suggests that social factors in the interaction impactlearning (e.g. Schnaubert and Bodemer, 2016). Until now, however, we have not had a well-defined, processoriented understanding of how dyadic rapport intersects with individual features like prior knowledge and selfefficacy to impact the process of learning in peer tutoring.In this paper, we identify a surprising interaction between rapport, prior knowledge, and self-efficacyon learning outcomes, and highlight the influence of each of those factors on tutoring and learning behaviors toshed light on the tutoring process. We find that tutors with greater rapport with their tutees offer more help andprompt for explanations more often, perhaps due to feelings of increased responsibility for their partner’sperformance (Wentzel, 1999) or to increased freedom to engage in unsolicited help-offering, knowing that it isless likely to be taken as face-threatening (Feng and Magen, 2013). Given these results, it seems the peertutoring process in dyads with high rapport is characterized by investment of the tutor in the comprehension andproblem-solving process of their tutee, wherein learners are motivated by a socially supportive environment toself-explain, without needing to continually request confirmation of their answers. To understand why tuteeswhose self-efficacy outstrips their prior knowledge might rely more on an answer-proposing and –checkingapproach, we turn to Williams and Takaku’s (2011) finding that such students demonstrated a performanceoriented approach to learning, instead of a mastery-orientation (Williams and Takaku, 2011). For such students,perhaps obtaining the correct answers to the problems is more critical than correctly understanding the concepts,which may support our unexpected conceptual learning result. Webb and Mastergeorge (2003) also argued thatdependency-oriented help requests may inadvertently signal to tutors that learners are unmotivated or unable tocomplete the problem, thus eliciting the steps or answers from the tutor, rather than the deeper conceptualexplanations learners may need (Parr and Townsend, 2002).It is in light of such results that designers of computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) tools,intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), or other artificial intelligence in education (AIED) applications should designsystems that can help establish this supportive climate of mutual nurturance and support, One example is“socially-aware” virtual tutors or teachable agents that can build rapport with their partners (as described inWalker and Ogan, 2016). Such systems should thus incorporate adaptive socially-aware behavior patterns thatelicit feelings of increasing rapport in the human learner, and be ready to deal with tutees’ learning behaviorsincreasingly in line with the findings here (i.e. verbalizing problem-solving steps, explaining reasoning, andproposing more answers).This study is not without limitations as the small sample size limits the power of the findings. Thefindings here may also not be generalizable beyond the age group or culture of the participants represented. Inaddition, these analyses were correlational, as we did not experimentally manipulate the rapport of the dyad.Future work may first explore a causal inference approach such as Granger causality to infer the causalrelationship between rapport and learning behaviors. We are also developing a rapport-building virtual peertutor to attempt to build rapport with students in an experimental study, to identify causal relationships betweenrapport and learning. Conversely, a teachable agent might strategically build rapport with a student to elicit thesupportive helping behaviors seen here. In sum, we intend for this paper to contribute to the growing body ofICLS 2018 Proceedings606© ISLSwork understanding the socio-cognitive processes by which learning occurs. In this paper, we offer an analysisof how dyadic rapport built between students meeting for the first time interacts with individuals’ self-efficacyand prior knowledge to impact their learning outcomes and their tutoring and learning behaviors, and we offerone approach to unpacking the sequential process of tutoring and learning as it unfolds over time.AcknowledgmentsThe research reported here was supported by the National Science Foundation Cyberlearning AwardNo.1523162, and the Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education, through GrantR305B150008 to Carnegie Mellon University.
