Phenomenography is known as a useful strategy to investigatevariations in conceptual understandings of different phenomena. The paper aims to: (1)examine the research papers in educational technology studies over the past 15 years (20032017), and (2) evaluate the feasibility of phenomenography in the field of educationaltechnology studies. A systematic review is done to the educational technology research papersthat involve the use of phenomenography. A systematic literature search in the 14 SSCIjournal websites produced 35 articles. Although there were only few papers which usedphenomenography as research approach in educational technology studies, there was a gradualrise in the number of studies using phenomenography across years, with more focus onstudying students’ learning experiences, especially in the higher education sector. Implicationsabout the use of phenomenography in educational technology field will be discussed.IntroductionEducational technology is defined as “the study and ethical practice of facilitating learning and improvingperformance by creating, using, and managing appropriate technological processes and resources” (Januszewski& Molenda, 2008, p.1). Educational technology is also associated with other terms like instructional technology,information technology (IT), information technology and communication (ICT), computer-supportedcollaborative learning, online learning, distance education and computer education (Pelgrum & Plomp, 2002).Educational technology is a rapidly growing research area with the big leaps of technology development in the21st century. This represents that the field of educational technology, also known as instructional technology, ispotentially a fast-growing pool for research development concerning the facilitation of learning and teachingwith the application of technology. Therefore, there is a need for evidence-based approach to inform ‘better’practices of educational technology. Interestingly, most educational technology studies were design-based andquasi-experimental (Amiel & Reeves, 2008).Systematic review: An overviewVarious literature reviews were carried out to investigate different applications of educational technology suchas hypermedia (e.g. Dillon & Gabbard, 1998), games (e.g. Randel et al., 1992), and so on. Some attempted toinquire the factors affecting the effectiveness of the use of educational technology, including learningenvironments (e.g. Winn, 2002), professional training and development (e.g. Daly, Pachler, & Pelletier, 2009),while some investigated the factors that affect the implementation of educational technology (e.g. Durlak &DuPre, 2008). Still, most of these reviews were either narrowly studied or loosely organized. Few were doubtedfor the trustworthiness as they might contain ‘questionable findings’ due to ‘under-examined assumptions’(Kirkwood, & Price, 2013, p.536). Systematic review has received much attention in scientific and academicfields for its great power in providing ‘high level of evidence’ to inform recommendations and contribute to thedevelopment of new knowledge (Higgins & Green, 2011). Recently, systematic reviews have been done to findout the recent trends on the application of different learning approaches, for example, problem-based learningapproach (Tsai & Chiang, 2013). They are also used to study the applications and impacts of different types ofeducational technologies such as flipped classrooms (e.g. Karabulut-Ilgu, Jaramillo & Jahren, 2017), games (e.g.Graafland, Schraagen, & Schijven, 2012).Phenomenography: Origins and usageThe use of phenomenography as a research approach has gradually received much attention from educationalresearchers (e.g. Entwistle, 1997), which is known as ‘a research method for mapping the qualitatively differentways in which people experience, conceptualize, perceive, and understand various aspects of, and variousphenomena in, the world around them’ (Marton, 1986, p.31). This approach is regarded as an effective approachto investigate variations in conceptual understandings of different phenomena (Bowden, & Walsh, 2000).Phenomenography is also recommended in studying educational technology due to its ‘potential impact thatICLS 2018 Proceedings1097© ISLSphenomenography and the relational perspectives have on pedagogical practices’ (Andretta, 2007, p.152).However, little is known about to what extent phenomenography can be applied in the context of educationaltechnology. To our knowledge, there is a lack of systematic review on the use of phenomenography in the fieldof educational technology research. Therefore, the objectives of this paper are: 1) to examine the research papersin educational technology studies over the past 15 years (2003-2017), and (2) to evaluate the feasibility ofphenomenography in the field of educational technology studies, with the following research questions: (1) Howis phenomenography applied in studying educational technology?, and (2) What are the key limitations andpossible future development in the use of phenomenography in educational technology studies as stated in thepublished articles in the SSCI journals?.MethodsThe review process involves data collection, data analysis and synthesis. Data were collected by the researcherswho identified the relevant papers from the Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) journals in the field ofeducational technology. We selected SSCI journals for review because these journals are of high quality andimpacts in the field. In order to identify the trend of the publication, we first targeted at finding the papers whichwere published in the recent 15 years (2003-2017). We then used keywords and search terms (e.g.phenomenographic study, phenomenography) in the SSCI journal websites. Only full-text available papers,which were written in English, were selected for review. After obtaining the set of papers, we organized thecontents of these selected papers according to the origin (location) of study, year of publication, data collectionmethod, targeted groups in the study, research questions, objectives of the study, open space, structural aspect,referential aspect and limitations of study. Data analysis include: (1) descriptive analysis (i.e. counting thenumber of published papers, origin of papers, targeted groups, data collection methods) with the use of MSExcel software, as well as (2) content analysis (i.e. thematic analysis) using coding strategies with the use ofNVivo (version 11.0) software that enables to generate and search for patterns as emerged from the contents ofthe papers (i.e. limitations of the study, future research directions) (Bazeley, 2013; Clarke & Braun, 2013). Apreset coding system was initially used to identify and construct themes. Examples of codes includedgeneralization of the study, challenges, solutions, forms of data collection, perspectives of stakeholders) andnumber of participants (sample size).Preliminary findingsResearch question 1: How is phenomenography applied in studying educationaltechnology?A total of 35 articles were identified in the systematic literature search from the 14 SSCI journal websites. Therewas a gradual increase in the number of studies using phenomenography across years (Table 1). Most of thesestudies focused on inquiring students’ learning experiences when using educational technology, whilst thesestudies were mostly conducted in the higher education sector.Table 1.

However, it is commonly revealed that such phenomenographic studies help enrich our understandingsof learning and teaching with the use of educational technology and therefore provide insights into preparing forfuture pedagogical applications of educational technology.Significance of the studyThe systematic review of the study will add to the current literature. First of all, this helps extend our knowledgeabout the use of phenomenography in the field of educational technology research by assessing itsmethodological rigors and practices. Second, the study provides evidence-based investigations of the feasibilityof phenomenographic approach and further improvise how this approach can be used and strengthened in theeducational technology field.ReferencesAmiel, T., & Reeves, T.
