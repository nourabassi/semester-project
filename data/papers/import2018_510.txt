Three Research Directions for Affective Learning TechnologiesAmy L. Baylor, National Science Foundation, amy.baylor@gmail.comAbstract: Looking to the future of advanced learning technology research, understanding,supporting and explicitly designing for the role of affect is of great importance. I highlightthree emerging areas of research with current research exemplars. First, simulating affect isnecessary to enhance human-like relationships with technology; for example, with artificiallyintelligent virtual agents, or teachable robots as learning companions. Second, sensing andresponding to learner affect in immersive learning experiences as well as learning at scale israpidly evolving; for example, through affective intelligent tutoring systems, or dashboardsdriven by multimodal analytics. Third, designing technology-based learning experiences thatpromote, elicit and support affective outcomes requires theory building within the learningsciences; for example, to realize outcomes such as empathy or curiosity and formulatelinkages to learning. Finally, I suggest how research in these areas of affective technologyafford new opportunities to prepare learners for future learning and work environments.IntroductionPerhaps the most uniquely human attribute in learning is the learner’s emotion or affective state (emotions,feelings, moods) during the learning process. A recent review of cyberlearning research reported that the role ofaffect and emotion in the learning sciences is of much interest (Roschelle, Martin, Ahn & Schank, 2017). Ingeneral, we might expect that states such as engagement, flow and curiosity enhance learning while other statessuch as frustration and boredom inhibit learning, although research indicates this is more complicated. In thedesign of learning technologies, accounting for these affective states is an important area of interdisciplinaryresearch that spans the fields of the learning and computer sciences, psychology, engineering, neuroscience, andother convergent fields such as affective computing and cyberpsychology.Three research directionsIn this crossover paper, I highlight three areas of research for affective learning technology: 1) Simulating affectto enhance the human-like aspects of the technology; 2) Sensing and responding to learner affect in immersiveenvironments and nonformal settings; and, 3) Supporting affective learning-related outcomes.Simulating affect to enhance human-like aspects of technologyBased on the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) paradigm (Reeves & Nass, 1998), there is much evidence tosupport that learners respond to technology as human-like, even if it is not conscious. For example, thepoliteness effect with virtual agents indicates that polite, socially intelligent, pedagogical agents can positivelyimpact learning (Wang et al., 2008), and there is strong evidence that virtual agents can serve as effective socialinfluencers (Baylor, 2011). For technology to provide affective and motivational support during learning, it ismore effective if it engages with the learner socially and emotionally.Walker and Ogan (2016) suggest that the artificial-intelligence in education (AIED) community shouldactively design such technology-mediated social relationships. Particularly for affect, we must design affectivecharacteristics that not only enhance the human-technology relationship but also align with the desiredinstructional role of the technology (e.g., as expert, mentor, learning companion, or peer; Kim & Baylor, 2016).Ultimately, making the technology more human-like can improve learning, through mechanisms such as the useof enthusiasm, (Lane et al., 2013) or the design of systems that “care” (Du Boulay et al., 2010).The design of affective characteristics may be clear and simple to provide a strong message, such asthrough the teachable robot “Quinn” that provides feedback to learners with facial emotions together with causalattributions regarding the learning process (Muldner, Girotto, Lozano, Burleson, & Walker, 2014). Or theaffective characteristics may be more complex to generate rapport with both emotional expression andnonverbal communication. For example, an embodied conversational agent serving as a virtual peer has rapportwith the learner to facilitate science achievement in a culturally diverse classroom (Finkelstein, Yarzebinski,Vaughn, Ogan, & Cassell, 2013).Overall, simulating affect to support and not detract from learning will likely lead to more human-likesystems that enhance learner engagement through human-technology partnerships. Particularly for intelligentsystems, more work is also needed to determine how technology should emote more realistic affect to showintention and/or articulate what is in the simulated “black box.”ICLS 2018 Proceedings1843© ISLSSensing and responding to learner affect in both immersive environments and largerscale nonformal settingsMoving from the technology to the learner, how can advanced learning technologies sense and respond tolearners’ affective states and the combination of affect and cognition that occurs in learning? We need to betterunderstand this within immersive learning experiences as well as more distant learning contexts such asMOOCs. A recent 2017 inaugural summit on Emotion AI (see http://go.affectiva.com/emotion-ai-summit)suggests the importance of designing such systems not only from the perspective of academia, but also industry.Arroyo and others (2009) described how “emotion sensors go to school” as integrated in an affectiveintelligent tutoring system. Continuing to the present day, the implementation of affect-aware systems is rapidlyevolving. For example, the game-based learning environment Crystal Island serves as a platform to investigatehow emotional responses, such as feelings of calm or tension, are involved in learning for middle grade scienceand literacy (Sabourin, Mott, & Lester, 2011). Incorporating advances from the affective neurosciences, theAffective Autotutor responds to student affective states including boredom, confusion and frustration(Immordino-Yang & Singh, 2011). For learning at scale, detecting learner engagement in MOOCs is importantto support student success. While self-reported affect data can be collected as a first step (Dillon et al., 2016),such systems are now starting to incorporate more intelligent affect-aware feedback (Grawemeyer et al., 2016).An interesting angle is the development of dashboards to provide “super-senses” for instructors toassess students’ cognition, metacognition, emotion, and motivation using multimodal data. These dashboardscan incorporate information from eye gaze behaviors, facial expressions of emotions, heart rate, andelectrodermal activity (Azevedo et al., 2017). A major challenge here is how to integrate multimodalinformation that may include multichannel physiological signals. More systematic research on interface designfor these dashboards is also needed to make them usable for teachers or other leaders. Importantly, as wecontinue to build such systems and integrate technologies such as detecting emotion through facial recognition,careful consideration must also be made to ethical issues including privacy.In this research area, more research is needed to better integrate multimodal data with other techniquessuch as natural language processing. Developing these affect-aware learning technologies requires advances incomputer science and engineering in particular, an area referred to as affective computing, per Picard’s classicbook (1995).Supporting affective learning-related outcomesFinally, we need research on the design of learning experiences to promote and support desirable affectiveoutcomes and related motivational constructs such as engagement, interest and curiosity. We also need theorybuilding in the learning sciences to understand these technology-mediated cognitive-affective states and makethe connections back to learning. For example, Leutner (2014) presents the Cognitive-Affective Theory ofLearning with Media (CATLM) as an extension of Mayer’s Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning, whichsuggests how affective features of instruction can increase learner engagement, generative processing, anddeeper learning. D’Mello and Graesser (2012) propose a model that describes the role of cognitivedisequilibrium and its dynamic relationship to learners’ affective states; specifically, that if such cognitivechallenges are resolved, the learners will return to a state of engagement/flow, but if not, can trigger frustrationand ultimately boredom. To support and understand affective learning outcomes in nonformal settings likeMOOCs, much more research is needed, and in particular, there is a need for more experimental approaches asnoted in a recent review article (Joksimović et al., 2017).What affective states should we promote and support and what are the unique affordances oftechnology? Immersive virtual reality (VR) environments are particularly powerful in the capacity to inducedistinct affective states such as joy, sadness, boredom, anger or anxiety (Felnhofer et al., 2015), and there areethical concerns given that simply acting as an avatar in VR, for example, can serve as an emotionally-intensiveexperience and have unintended impact. On the positive side, perspective-taking as implemented throughtechnology can serve as an effective way to promote empathy. Ben Shapiro’s initial work(https://www.colorado.edu/atlas/pet-project) involves students designing wearable technology that allow them tosense the world through the eyes of a pet; for example, they create earmuffs that allow for the frequencies thatdogs hear, and augmented reality lenses that simulates dog vision. Through this perspective-taking, studentsdevelop empathy for the pet and this in turn facilitates their curiosity to ask scientific questions and enhancetheir overall interest in the scientific process. Accordingly, curiosity is a valuable outcome in relation to STEMlearning, and there is much recent interest (e.g., a recent ACM SIG CHI 2016 workshop) in designing systemsto support it and the closely related concepts of serendipity, interest, intrinsic motivation and goal-setting, andcreativity.1844Research in this area should advance our understanding of which affective learning outcomes to targetand the implications for the design of learning technologies. If we were to explicitly design systems to elicitfeelings of delight and surprise (which Baker and colleagues found to be rare (2010)) and even those of awe andwonder, the possibilities for enhancing interest in content such as STEM could be profound.Conclusions and implicationsTable 1 below provides a summary of these three research areas (e.g., simulating, sensing, and supportinglearning affect), exemplars reflecting the current state, and future directions.Table 1: Affective learning technology research: State-of-the-art and future directionsResearch areaCurrent state-of-the-artFuture directionsAffect-awaresystems(Sensing learneraffect)affective intelligent tutoringsystems; dashboards withmultimodal data; MOOCs thatassess learner engagementGenerating more meaningful learning-relatedinformation from multi-channel multimodal data;role of emotion AI and learning; more sensitivedetection and modeling of learner affect for learningat scaleAffective learningoutcomes(Supporting learneraffect)Support flow/engagement;cognitive disequilibrium asintegral to the learningprocessDiscovering new strategies to elicit emotions such asempathy, delight, curiosity; modeling the complexrelationship with learning and cognition; deeperinvestigation of the affordances VRHuman-liketechnology(Simulating affect)artificially intelligent virtualagents; social robotsIncreasing realism, rapport, and socialresponsiveness; systems emoting to inform learner ofintention and generating interest and buy-inAs we prepare learners for the future of work, the role of affect is fundamental for both designing and workingwithin immersive and intelligent environments where technology can understand and use emotion in itspartnership with the learner or worker. Such cyber-human systems of the future must both understand, respondto and communicate with gesture, emotional expressions and nonverbal behaviors.Each of these three directions requires a highly interdisciplinary, or convergent, approach to understandthe theoretical and empirical underpinnings of affective learning technologies. This can be problematic inevaluating impact- i.e., which field gets to determine the parameters for evaluation? Here it is important tobroaden the scope of relevant research, and bring flexible, multi-dimensional evaluation lenses to bear insupport of these exciting new directions.ReferencesArroyo, I., Cooper, D.
