Negotiation Towards Intersubjectivity and Impacts on ConceptualOutcomesCatherine L. Dornfeld and Sadhana Puntambekarcldornfeld@wisc.edu; puntambekar@education.wisc.eduUniversity of Wisconsin–MadisonAbstract: To achieve a collective goal, students collaborating in groups must share theirinterpretations of the goal to negotiate a shared understanding, or establish intersubjectivity,before making progress towards that goal. To investigate negotiation towards intersubjectivityalong with students’ conceptual outcomes, we studied the discourse of two groups of middleschool students who participated in a 12-week science curriculum. We also evaluateddifferences in scores on a physics assessment. We found differences in how groups negotiatedshared understandings of tasks and concepts and how they participated in conceptual discourse.Group A required significantly more instances of negotiation to establish intersubjectivitycompared to Group B, indicating that Group A struggled with establishing sharedunderstandings. Students in Group A also demonstrated greater variance in conceptual discourseand assessment scores, whereas Group B demonstrated more aligned conceptual outcomes.These results indicate that effective negotiation for establishing intersubjectivity is not only animportant first step for students’ participation in conceptual discourse, but also for achievingbalanced learning gains across group members.Keywords: collaboration, intersubjectivity, conceptual discourse, learning outcomes, CSCLIntroductionSmall groups participating in coordinated activities must establish intersubjectivity, or shared understanding ofthe current activity; this often occurs through group discourse (Rogoff, 1990; Wertsch, 1979; Jarvela, 1995; Rowe,2011). Upon initiating group work, each group member may have different interpretations of the shared goal andits sub-components, even when group members receive identical instructions, content, and/or materials. As aresult, each group member may describe the current activity differently in terms of the goal itself, necessary tasks,relevant domain knowledge, intentions, and affective responses (Rummel, Dieglmayr, Spada, Kahrimanis, &Avouris, 2011; Jarvela, 1995). For example, students collecting physics data with a rollercoaster simulation mayhave different understandings of physics concepts; different ways to use classroom tools to collect, record, andorganize task-related information; and different connections between collected data, initial hypotheses, and finalconclusions. In this example, we can see multiple opportunities for different interpretations – and thus a need tonegotiate shared understandings. Different interpretations of the goal and its components necessitate dedicateddiscourse for establishing intersubjectivity, particularly during collaborative decision-making (Barron, 2003).Students must reveal their reasoning through sharing, negotiating, and jointly creating understandings of the goalin order to make progress.Group members’ interpretations or understandings may be described as situation definitions (Wertsch,1984). During group work, students actively create mental representations of the current situation or activity.However, different students may have different representations. Differences among representations may arisefrom differences in individual zones of proximal development (ZPD) within the group, especially whenconsidering prior knowledge (Vygotsky, 1978; Wertsch, 1984). Students may define and decompose a situation(e.g., goal, task, or concepts) differently based on their actual levels of development. Additionally, situationdefinitions are located in time and subject to change. Students may alter and adapt their representations as theyencounter others’ perspectives and co-construct knowledge (Park & Moro, 2006). These evolving situationdefinitions may be described as fluctuations, which are developed as co-construction “through the process ofconflict, negotiation, and renegotiation about the activity during interactions” (Park & Moro, 2006, p. 113)occurring as utterances over time (Rowe, 2011; Hall, 2011; Rommetveit, 1976). Fluctuations help the group toovercome rigid (and possibly inaccurate) representations. They also allow the group to develop a collectivesituation definition for the activity based on their negotiated understandings.As group members share and iterate on their situation definitions, they also engage in negotiation ofshared conceptual understanding. Collaborative learning involves mutual construction and negotiation ofcognition through interactions, such as patterns in discourse (Roschelle, 1992; Rummel et al., 2011; Barron, 2003).Group members collaboratively co-construct meaning as they negotiate conceptual situation definitions. ThroughICLS 2016 Proceedings562© ISLSa progression of contributing and listening, group members build mutually shared cognition (Baker, 1994; Miyake& Kirschner, 2014; Barron, 2003; Roschelle, 1992). Beyond ensuring that students have similar conceptualunderstandings, mutually shared cognition is also associated with greater group effectiveness (Miyake &Kirschner, 2014).In this study, we investigated how two small groups engaged in negotiation of situation definitions oftasks and concepts as they participated in a science curriculum. We used a comparative case-study approach toinvestigate two research questions: How did negotiation of situation definitions move students towardsestablishing intersubjectivity, and how did negotiation towards intersubjectivity impact conceptual outcomes overtime? By investigating these questions, we aim to reveal potential relationships between collaborative groupdynamics and meaning-making outcomes. We also aim to identify opportunities for interventions within groupdiscourse that increase the likelihood of greater learning outcomes for all group members.MethodsTo study negotiation of situation definitions and students’ conceptual understandings, we examined the discourseof two small groups over a 12-week science curriculum. The groups participated in the CoMPASS project(Puntambekar, Stylianou, & Goldstein, 2007), which investigated how students developed science literacy as theyinteracted with digital textbooks and other distributed scaffolds. CoMPASS was designed as a 12-week designbased physics curriculum that applied physics concepts such as forces, work, energy, and motion to roller coasterdesign. Students collaborated in small groups and used a computer simulation, a digital textbook (CoMPASS),and scientist’s journals throughout the unit. The experiments involved students’ manipulation of variables withinthe simulation to discover relationships between concepts. In this study, we examine how students negotiatedshared understandings of goals, activities, and concepts during four of the experiment sessions using acombination of cognitive ethnography and comparative case studies (Puntambekar, 2013; Barron, 2003).ParticipantsFor our two cases, we selected two groups of four sixth-grade students (N = 8) from the larger study sample. Thesegroups were selected because they were from the same classroom, instructed by the same teacher, and attendedthe same CoMPASS sessions. Participants also had similar prior knowledge based on pre-test scores (see DataSources). Their class consisted of 22 students divided into six groups. Group A’s students included Simon, Ben,Ali, and Mallory. Group B’s students included Zach, Lucas, Morgan, and Ana. They attended a large suburbanpublic middle school in the U.S. Midwest.Data sourcesWe collected video and audio data of the groups’ experiment sessions over a 12-week curriculum (14 sessionstotal). We selected four sessions to analyze discourse over time: two sessions (1 & 3) from the beginning of theunit, and two (13 & 14) from the end of the unit. All group members were present for each session.We also used a test designed by the project that assessed understanding of physics concepts. This testwas administered prior to and after the 12-week implementation. The test consisted of 29 items related torelationships between forces, work, energy, friction, and Newton’s Laws. Correct answers received one pointwhile incorrect answers received zero points; the maximum score was 29 points. The groups’ pre-test scores werenot significantly different, indicating that students in both groups had similar prior knowledge.AnalysisQualitative analysisOverall, students in both groups contributed 1579 total turns of talk over the four sessions. After reviewing severalsessions, we designed a grounded coding scheme that focused on conceptual and procedural and negotiation insmall-group discourse. This two-dimensional coding scheme (see Table A1 in Appendix) focused on how studentsestablished common ground through negotiation in discourse. Each turn of talk was coded for content (PurposeCode) and progression towards shared understanding, or intersubjectivity (Negotiation Code). Turns that did notfit these categories were coded as Off-Task (19.7% of turns) or N/A (7.0% of turns). Multiple codes werepermitted for turns of talk. For inter-rater reliability, we achieved a Cohen’s kappa value of 0.904 with an externalcoder for a subset of the data. Differences were resolved through further discussion.Quantitative analysisWe used quantitative analyses to compare differences between and within groups, using turns of talk as our unitof analysis. We calculated frequencies and proportions of coded turns of talk for groups and individual students.ICLS 2016 Proceedings563© ISLSTo compare Groups A and B, we performed two-tailed tests of homogeneity for proportions of coded turns (criticalz-score = +/-1.96, α = 0.05). To study differences over time, we used nonparametric chi-square tests to comparePurpose (2 x 4) and Negotiation (3 x 4) coded contributions over the four sessions for each group. To assessconceptual outcomes, we compared proportions of individual students’ contributions to conceptual talk over thefour sessions. We also calculated learning gains on the physics conceptual assessment (as differences in pre-postscores), along with the mean, standard deviation, and range of learning gains for each group to understand howgroups’ conceptual understandings developed over time.FindingsGroup differences in talk and changes over timeTo see how the two groups negotiated situation definitions, we compared both groups’ coded contributions to talkover four sessions. Table 1 shows that Group A contributed significantly more suggestions (0.124 vs. 0.094, z =2.607, p = 0.009), agreements (0.043 vs. 0.025, z = 2.778, p = 0.005), and disagreements (0.046 vs. 0.029, z =2.485, p = 0.013) than Group B over the unit. Group A engaged in cycles of suggesting and disagreeing with ideassignificantly more often than Group B. In contrast, Group B engaged in more off-task talk (0.136 vs. 0.075, z = 5.366, p < 0.001) than Group A over the unit. Considering that both groups had the same amount of time forexperiment sessions, Group A may have struggled to establish shared understandings, while Group B readilyestablished shared understandings and thus had time available to engage in unrelated talk. Overall, Group Aengaged in negotiation of situation descriptions significantly more often than Group B.Table 1. Group comparison z-scores for proportions of talk. Positive values indicate greater contributions fromGroup A, while negative values indicate greater contributions from Group B. *Significant result at p < 0.05.Session131314OverallPurpose CodeTaskLearning0.1382.434*-0.616-0.2232.111*0.548-0.3731.1700.6711.427Suggesting-0.814-0.2903.526*2.018*2.607*Negotiation CodeAgreeingDisagreeing3.430*-2.022*0.0842.306*1.5862.497*0.4972.436*2.778*2.485*Off-Task-2.764*2.223*-6.138*-2.059*-5.366*We also evaluated contributions of talk over time. We used chi-square tests to detect session-baseddifferences in groups’ turns of talk related to Purpose (2 x 4 test) and Negotiation (3 x 4 test). Both groupscontributed significantly more task-based and learning talk between sessions over time (Group A: χ2 = 9.919, p =0.0193; Group B: χ2 = 14.166, p = 0.0027), indicating that both groups engaged in more turns of talk more overtime. Also, both groups demonstrated significant differences in the frequency of suggestions, agreements, anddisagreements over time (Group A: χ2 = 16.718, p = 0.0104; Group B: χ2 = 16.928, p = 0.0096), indicating thatthe types of their contributions varied significantly over time.Conceptual understanding over timeThis unit was designed to facilitate learning of concepts through collaboration and interaction with distributedscaffolds. We would ideally see improved conceptual outcomes for all group members (i.e., all students benefitedfrom the unit). To assess conceptual outcomes, we studied group members’ contributions to conceptual discourseover four experiment sessions (as seen in Table A2) along with performance on the conceptual assessment. Wecalculated pre-post differences for each student, or learning gains, in assessment scores along with the mean,standard deviation, and range of learning gains for each group.To see how groups’ contributions to learning-based discourse varied over the unit, we examineddifferences between group members’ proportions of conceptual discourse (from highest to lowest proportions).Figures 1 and 2 (below) show individual students’ contributions to conceptual discourse over time. We see thatGroup A demonstrated greater differences between students ranging from 0.041 (Session 1) to 0.114 (Session 14;see Table A3 in Appendix for all differences). Group A’s contributions to conceptual discourse were highly variedbetween students over time, indicating that some group members participated in conceptual discourse more oftenthan others. In contrast, Group B demonstrated differences between students ranging from 0.000 (no difference;Session 1) to 0.054 (Session 14). This indicates that students in Group B contributed relatively similar levels ofconceptual discourse over time than Group A.ICLS 2016 Proceedings564© ISLSOverall, students in Group B were more aligned in their individual contributions to conceptual discoursethan students in Group A. This fits with both groups’ learning gains on the conceptual assessment. Table 2 showsthat Group A’s scores showed greater variance (SD = 5.377, range = 13), while Group B’s showed less variance(SD = 1.291, range = 3). Overall, students in Group A demonstrated greater variance in conceptual outcomeswhile Group B demonstrated relatively similar conceptual outcomes.Proportion of DiscourseGroup A's Conceptual Discourse0.1400.1200.100Simon0.080Mallory0.060Ben0.040Ali0.0200.000Session 1Session 3Session 13 Session 14Figure 1.

GroupA’s discourse frequently involved negotiation as initial suggestions followed by disagreements and/or severalalternative suggestions. In this excerpt, Group A reached a standstill in their decision for a rollercoaster simulationICLS 2016 Proceedings565© ISLSvariable. The goal for this activity was to stop a rollercoaster car in a way that was quick and efficient but did notput excessive force on the riders. Mallory and Ben had different interpretations of the lesson goal; Malloryprioritized shorter stopping distance, while Ben prioritized rider safety. They attempted to explain their reasoningto each other, but their conversations were cut short by Ali and Simon, who prioritized completing the task overreasoning through debate (turns 5 and 10).Ali:I think we should do 3 anyway.Ben:I think we should do 2.5. That works.Mallory:It’s not going to help if we take a vote. It’s going to be two-on-two.Ben:‘Cause 3 just stopped it too fast. No, no. It’s not fair. It’s not scientific-y.Ali:Let’s just do it.Ben:No, it’s not fair. Why do you guys think it’s 3?Ali:Because, um, it takes, um, less [inaudible] and less track to stop it, and it’s still safeand efficient.Ben:2.5 was more efficient. Uh, 2.5 is more safe. And it still doesn’t take that muchtrack.Ali:It took --Simon:Let’s just do this right now and worry about that when we’re at the simulation.In contrast, Group B’s discourse typically involved brief instances of negotiation in which students made decisionsbased on earlier experiments. In this excerpt, students in Group B considered different rollercoaster hill heightvalues, car masses, and friction levels for a complex simulation experiment with multiple input variables. We seeevidence of students actively listening to suggestions and repeating them to confirm. Students were able to finishutterances and justify ideas without interruption.Teacher:So if this is your hill height, you don’t have a – you can still change the value.You just don’t have a ton of wiggle room.Lucas:80, 85, and 90.Morgan:For this you can do 0.2, 0.4, 0.6.Ana:Yeah, for our car masses we’re doing 0.2, 0.4, 0.6.Lucas:0.2 K, 0.4, 0.6 K.Ana:I think our friction level should be four.Zach:What page is that on?Morgan:Well, for our friction level we agreed because that was the one that was, like,the most safe.Overall, we see that Group A’s discourse included unproductive debate and frequent interruptions duringexplanations, which resulted in incomplete reasoning in decision-making. Group B’s discourse included repetitionof suggestions to indicate confirmation and productive debate involving active listening and full explanations.While both groups debated how to set up their experiments, Group B’s communication and negotiation practicesfacilitated clarity in suggestions, explanations, and decision-making over the unit.DiscussionIn this study, we investigated how students in small groups negotiated shared understandings, or establishedintersubjectivity, through their discourse moves. We focused on two questions: How did negotiation of situationdefinitions move students towards establishing intersubjectivity, and how did negotiation towards intersubjectivityimpact conceptual outcomes over time? We found that Group A engaged in significantly more negotiationdiscourse than Group B. Group A required more negotiation of tasks and relevant concepts than Group B, whichICLS 2016 Proceedings566© ISLSmay be explained by Group B’s better externalization and negotiation habits, such as sharing mental models ofconcepts and actively listening. Also, Group B demonstrated relative ease in reaching consensus on sharedsituation definitions compared to Group A; thus, they did not require as much negotiation. Overall, Group Bestablished intersubjectivity as shared situation definitions more effectively than Group A.We evaluated group meaning-making by examining contributions to conceptual discourse. Students inGroup A contributed to conceptual discourse in highly varying levels over the unit, while students in Group Bcontributed to discourse at similar levels over the unit. Group A’s varied levels of conceptual discourse alignedwith their varied learning gains; Ben gained 10 points from pre- to post-test, while Ali lost 3 from pre- to posttest. Group B’s similarity in conceptual discourse contributions aligned with their similar learning gains; Anagained 4 points while Zach gained 7 points. We believe that Group A’s increased instances of negotiation mayhave negatively impacted their developing conceptual understandings; they never seemed to be “on the samepage.” In 50-minute classroom sessions, increased time spent on debating situation definitions, especially asunproductive argumentation, limited engagement in conceptual discourse and resulted in differential learninggains for group members. However, students who effectively negotiated shared understandings of the task alongwith relevant concepts showed similar conceptual outcomes for all group members, possibly explained as reachingmutually shared cognition.Another lens for study could investigate social dynamics, such as control, in each group. One studentmaintained control of the shared computer in Group A, while the students in Group B rotated control of thecomputer. Control over resources can impact adoption of discrete roles, such as technology manager, and alterparticipation in discourse (Dornfeld & Puntambekar, 2015). This could also impact negotiation of actions andshared understandings. Following studies would involve investigation of relationships between control of sharedresources and constraints on negotiation towards intersubjectivity. Students who control the computer take on arole with power and responsibilities, which may impact group dynamics and participation in discourse.Additionally, examination of specific sequences of discourse moves may provide insight into productive (orunproductive) negotiation for establishing intersubjectivity. Sequential pattern analysis of coded turns of talk mayreveal ideal or problematic negotiation patterns as intervention targets. For example, if teachers observe a knownproblematic sequence, such as repetitive arguments, they may intervene and help students to externalize situationdefinitions and reach consensus. Finally, we plan to develop interventions that evenly distribute and increaselearning gains for group members.The main limitation to this study is the small sample size of students (N = 8) and limited diversity in thesample, which decreases generalizability to other populations. However, investigation of this small samplepermitted fine-grained analysis of group discourse over the unit. Replication of this study with a larger samplecould provide evidence to support our finding that effective negotiation towards intersubjectivity may help groupmembers achieve similar conceptual gains.Implications and conclusionThis study indicates that establishing shared situation definitions, or intersubjectivity, is a precursor to optimalconceptual outcomes for group collaboration. Collaboration necessitates that students negotiate sharedrepresentations of their goals and relevant concepts. In this science curriculum, students needed to shareinterpretations of their collective goal and its sub-components to effectively make decisions, carry outexperiments, and understand the conceptual relationships at work. The theoretical implication of this studyinvolves the importance of intersubjectivity in achieving similar conceptual understanding for group members.This study reveals another piece of how collaboration processes vary between groups and impact how students’conceptual outcomes. Group negotiation of shared understandings is not always easy. For example, students withdifferent zones of proximal development may define situations very differently and thus require additionalnegotiation towards shared understandings. For practical implications, this study allows identification ofopportunities for instructor-based interventions involving effective negotiation of situation definitions. Forexample, teachers may model ideal discourse practices or class norms. Also, teachers can monitor groups forineffective discourse patterns (such as when groups appear to be “stuck”), and then intervene with suggestions orscaffolds for building intersubjectivity and shared meaning-making.Overall, negotiation towards intersubjectivity appears to have consequences for students’ conceptualoutcomes when participating in small-group work. Groups that are able to co-construct shared situation definitionsmay show similarities in understanding domain areas, such as physics concepts. However, groups with ineffectivenegotiation practices may fail to co-construct shared situation definitions and show differential learning outcomes.If we aim for balanced collaborative learning outcomes in small-group work, we must identify and encourageeffective negotiation practices, such as externalization and meaning-making strategies within group discourse.ICLS 2016 Proceedings567© ISLSReferencesBaker, M.
