A Long-Term View on Learning to Argue in Facebook:The Effects of Group Awareness Toolsand Argumentation ScriptsThomas Puhl, Dimitra Tsovaltzi and Armin Weinbergert.puhl@edutech.uni-saarland.de, d.tsovltzi@edutech.uni-saarland.de, a.weinberger@edutech.uni-saarland.deSaarland UniversityAbstract: Social networking sites pose a new arena for argumentative practices and mayprovide an opportunity to facilitate, and understand argumentative processes in large scaleover longer periods of time. Through apps, group awareness tools and argumentation scriptscan be implemented in social networking sites, to provide additional, graphically visualizedinformation, and prompt learners to formulate or review sound arguments. This 2×2 fieldstudy (N=105) examines how Facebook can be harnessed for argumentative learning throughgroup awareness tools and argumentation scripts. We measure domain-specific knowledgeoutcomes, the process of argumentative knowledge construction and attitude change. Theresults show a main effect for both conditions on domain-specific knowledge andargumentative knowledge construction, but no difference to the control group on attitudechange. The epistemic quality and formal quality increased for the groups with argumentationscript. All observed changes become substantial after the fourth week of interactions.Keywords: argumentation, group awareness, scripts, social networking sites, long-term studyArgumentative knowledge construction in social networking sitesSocial networking sites (SNS) afford collaborative processes that may be harnessed for learning (Greenhow,2008; Greenhow & Robelia, 2009). SNS may offer a rich argumentative context that can pronounce processes ofargumentative knowledge construction (AKC). AKC is the deliberate practice of elaborating learning materialand discussion topics by constructing formally and semantically sound arguments with the goal of gainingargumentative and domain-specific knowledge (Andriessen, 2006). With SNS being prone to trivial talk, AKCin SNS may greatly benefit from instructional approaches of CSCL (Tsovaltzi, Puhl, Judele & Weinberger,2014; Tsovaltzi, Judele, Puhl & Weinberger, in review). Moreover, recent research has revealed that whileargumentation skills can be fostered by controlled short-term technology-enhanced instructional approaches, nosubstantial effects on domain-specific knowledge can be attained with these approaches (Wecker & Fischer,2014). One reason could be that complex and meaningful learning such as argumentative learning takes time(Reimann, Utz, Unterberger & Halb, 2014). Long-term interventions have been suggested before to successfullyfoster argumentation skills with young adolescents (Kuhn & Crowell, 2011). However, existing approacheshave often been too coercive for learners to actively regulate their individual or group AKC processes(Dillenbourg, 2002), and others might be too subtle to have an effect on learners' self-regulation or the coregulation of the group (Phielix, Prins & Kirschner, 2010). Can SNS, like Facebook, productively hostargumentative knowledge construction? How can the combination of rather coercive scripts, and less coercivegroup awareness tools (GATs), foster the development of learners’ AKC?Argumentation scriptsArgumentation scripts are a prominent approach to foster AKC in CSCL environments (Noroozi, Weinberger,Biemans, Mulder, & Chizari, 2012). Scripts are socio-cognitive structures that specify learners’ interactions incollaborative learning scenarios, aiming to either activate existing internal scripts, organize, or re-organizeinternally represented pieces of information, mostly declarative, that may constitute new elements of scripts(Fischer, Kollar, Stegmann & Wecker, 2013). Internal scripts are already represented in the learners’ cognitivesystem that are prone to change and adaptation. External scripts suggest collaborative processes and can changethe learners’ behavior over time through internalization (Kollar, Fischer & Slotta, 2007). In terms ofcollaborative argumentation processes, the internalization of an external script can guide learners to structure,discuss about, and reflect on their arguments, which can foster knowledge co-construction, argumentative anddomain-specific knowledge (Weinberger, Stegmann & Fischer, 2010), and structure students’ discussion ofconflicting opinions (Jermann & Dillenbourg, 1999; Felton & Kuhn, 2001). In the ArgueGraph script (Jermann& Dillenbourg, 1999 & 2002; Kobbe, Weinberger, Dillenbourg, Harrer, Hämäläinen, Häkkinen & Fischer,CSCL 2015 Proceedings110© ISLS2007), differences in opinions on seminar topics where represented to the students in order to increase sociocognitive conflict. Students were then asked to resolve these differences in dyads and reach an agreement bywriting arguments derived for their learning materials. Discourse analysis showed that students often providedconditional responses, in accordance with the high-order learning goal of the course.Group awareness toolsGATs are used in CSCL scenarios to enhance collaboration processes and also to foster domain-specificknowledge by giving students information about other learners, such as individual knowledge (Janssen &Bodemer, 2013). GATs can reveal inconsistent knowledge or differences of views and thus enhancecontroversial CSCL discussions, and impact group processes, like socio-emotional and motivational processesthat are meant to support AKC (Buder & Bodemer, 2008). GATs also make group processes or attitudesexplicit, for instance by visualizing how learners evaluate their own and the group’s cognitive and socialinteractions (Phielix, Prins, Kirschner, Erkens, & Jaspers, 2011). Group awareness of knowledge distribution inthe group has been shown to counteract negative effects of overly high levels of both mutual trust and mutualskepticism (Engelmann, Kolodziej, & Hesse, 2014). Moreover, GATs have been shown to enable groupprocesses that may support knowledge co-construction, like mutual modelling, (Sangin, Molinari, Nüssli &Dillenbourg, 2011), and group conflict (Phielix, Prins & Kirschner, 2010). There are first indications of positiveeffects of GATs on learning gains (Sangin et al., 2011). In particular, GATs that visualized cognitive conflict inthe form of discrepancies in the group solutions (Bodemer, 2011) or of summary of anonymous opinions (Buder& Bodemer, 2008) have been found to enable collaborative discussion of conflicting perspectives, fosterindividual learning gains, and increase critical argument elaboration during collaboration, as well as individualand group attitude change. GATs are positively related to performance and process satisfaction (Phielix et al,2010) and can prove particularly useful for learning in SNS such as Facebook to help group members considerthe distribution of knowledge and attitudes, spot their own positions in relation to other members. Such groupawareness may foster socio-cognitive conflict, in the sense of social tensions (e. g., why is my position differentto others?) and personal dissonance (e. g., how can I bridge two contradicting views?).Attitude changeAttitude change has been investigated in the context of argumentative knowledge construction in young students(Kuhn, Shaw,&Felton, 1997), showing a tendency to more stable positions with increasing age, and incomputer-mediated communication, revealing lack of readiness to consider alternative perspectives whenattitude markers are salient (Sassenberg & Boos, 2003). Argumentative processes, like taking into accountmultiple perspectives and resolving conflicting opinions appear to facilitate attitude change (Eagly & Chaiken,1995; Erber, Hodges, & Wilson, 1993) and may ultimately lead learners to re-consider initial standpoints(Tsovaltzi et al., 2013). Moreover, vocational training includes practicing attitude and communication at thework place (Nasir, 2002), e.g. for medical doctors (Caralis & Hammond, 1992) and teachers (Ihmeideh & Alomari, 2010). Theory on attitude change supports that change is the result of dissonance that can be caused bycognitive conflict between different attitudes of the same person (Eagly & Chaiken, 1995; Erber, Hodges, &Wilson, 1993). Such conflicts could potentially be made salient with GATs and productively resolved withscripts. GATs may contribute to making learners’ ideas, misconceptions, and contradictions accessible toscrutiny (Nussbaum, 2008). Scripts have been found to effectively specify and support how learners jointlyargue to address conflicts (Weinberger et al., 2010).We investigate the effects of a GAT and argumentation script on domain-specific learning outcomes,learning processes, and attitude change. We conjecture that the GAT will induce socio-cognitive conflict andwill translate into argumentative processes. We also conjecture that the argumentation script will foster thequality of arguments in the discussion. Therefore, they will both increase the domain-specific learning gains.The combination of both factors will interact in a positive way. We also hypothesize a positive effect of theGAT on attitude change.MethodsWe conducted a 2×2 quasi-experimental field-study with German teacher trainees (N=105) and factors GAT andargumentation script. Participants were taking part in a seminar on “Communication and Interaction”. In theintervention, all participants attended weekly seminars where a new theory on communication was presentedand discussed. After the seminar, the students had to fill out a questionnaire about their communication attitude.Seminar groups were accompanied by Facebook groups, where students weekly received a theory-related taskthat required them to interact and discuss online within five days. The study was part of the seminar and lastedthe whole semester. Students had to fill out the communication attitude questionnaire on nine sessions and wereCSCL 2015 Proceedings111© ISLSinstructed to reflect on the seminar theories while filling in the questionnaire. On eight sessions, anargumentation script was given as feedback to the quality of the written arguments.Before the intervention all participants took a knowledge pre-test, and filled in a questionnaire onsocio-demographic data, subjective knowledge in the domain “Communication and Interaction”, computer andFacebook use behavior. In addition they filled in a communication attitude questionnaire and the experimentalconditions were familiarized with the GAT. Similarly, after the intervention at the end of the semester, allparticipants took a knowledge post-test and filled in another questionnaire on their subjective learning gains andtheir acceptance of the learning environment.Group awareness toolFigure 1. Group awareness tool in FacebookStudents receiving GAT-based support reflected on their hypothetical personal communication attitude as ateacher by answering a case-based communication questionnaire with cases from every-day social interactionsin the school. Every scenario was followed by four Likert-scaled answers, focusing on how a teacher may reflecton and behave in the situation. Moreover, the questions differed with respect to whether the emphasis was onmulti-perspective / flexible attitudes vs. goal-oriented / structured attitudes, following Buder & Bodemer (2008)and Jermann & Dillenbourg (1999, 2002), both rated on a scale from 0 to 6. The result of the questionnaire waspresented to the experimental groups with a GAT implemented as a Facebook app. The app graphicallyvisualized the position of a student with respect to communication attitude in relation to other students. Theposition in the graphic is represented as relative to the position of the whole seminar group (I vs. the others).The GAT also gave them the opportunity to identify the person behind a position by moving the mouse over thepoint on the graphic to see the name and a photo of the person (Figure 1), so the discussions were notanonymous. The design of the GAT is oriented on the ArgueGraph script (Jermann & Dillenbourg, 1999) andaims at increasing socio-cognitive conflict. ArgueGraph was adjusted to the Facebook learning environment.That is, considering the Facebook dynamic, which means frequent interactions in the large group and lessCSCL 2015 Proceedings112© ISLSdiscursive discussions compared to a small group CSCL scenario, we used a less coercive instruction and didnot force the students to reach an agreement.Argumentation scriptStudents in the condition with script-based support received a weekly argumentation script in the form offeedback to arguments posted in the Facebook group discussion. They had to read all arguments of thediscussion and “like” the best argument in their own opinion. Feedback was given to every group for the mostliked argument and also for the best argument in the opinion of the teacher. The feedback to these twoarguments evaluated the epistemic (theoretical concepts and relations) and the formal (reasoning and evidence)quality of arguments for the two selected arguments. It also indicated whether an important part of the argumentwas missing or illustrated how a sound argument should look like. While the structure and the ontology of thescript were standardized, it was also important to adapt the script to the different weekly tasks and the differentarguments from each group.InstrumentsDomain-specific knowledge was assessed by a course exam at the end of the semester containing definitions,facts, and higher order discursive processes like theory-based interpretations and argumentations. Theknowledge test included 10 multiple choice items and 13 open questions with a high inter-rater reliability k=.88,p=000. The internal consistency of the knowledge test was good (α = .69).Process analysis was based on Weinberger & Fischer (2006) on multi-level analysis of AKC processesand on an adapted version for argumentation in Facebook (Tsovaltzi, Judele, Puhl & Weinberger, 2014). Wemeasured epistemic and formal quality of arguments. The formal quality of arguments (k=.80, p=000) wasmeasured by the correct formal structure of the argument (e.g. if justifications were used for every argument),the quality of the justification and the quality of the reference. We evaluated the quality of justifications bygiving a score of three points for references to scientific results, two points for examples that may be used toexplain the content of an argument, and one point for every-day knowledge that provides some potential insightbut without scientific evidence. The actual citation of references was evaluated in addition to the justification.The quality of references was rated with two for a scientific reference (e.g. journal paper) and one for a link to arelevant internet site (e.g. wikipedia). The epistemic quality (k=.76, p=000) was measured by the quality of theused concepts or theories and the relations between them. We evaluated the quality of theories advocated in thearguments by giving a score of three points for a related theory to the discussed topic, which is thetheory/theories of the week, two for using the theory of the current week, and one for subjective theories thathave no scientific background. A relation drawn between current and other theories was also rated with threeand added to the overall score for epistemic quality. The posts from the second seminar sessions in the Facebookgroup were not analyzed because of a different weekly task. The students were given a task to reflect on nonverbal communication and post a personal experience they had in this week. Therefore there was no discussionin this week and no arguments to analyze.Communication attitude change was measured using the results of the communication questionnaire.The questionnaire was based on the situation assessment test for consulting (Keller, Bruder & Schmitz, 2010)and used scenarios to assess the communication attitudes of the participants. Contrary to the elaboratedscenarios in the consulting questionnaire, the scenarios in the communication attitude questionnaire are concisefor students to fill in on a weekly basis. Students were asked to reflect on the communication situations in thequestionnaire and indicate how they would behave as teachers in the sketched situations. For example, ascenario presented the situation in which most of the students failed in a test. The teacher could either handlethis situation by simply ascertaining that they did not study enough, or by discussing with them what theythought was the problem. Furthermore the teacher could offer to repeat the test, or discuss different possibilitieswith the students such as repeating the test or talking about the situation with the school principle. There are nocorrect answers to the questionnaire, but different theories from the ones taught in the seminar could support thedifferent options (Puhl, Tsovaltzi & Weinberger, in press). Students expressed their attitude by indicating theiragreement on the Likert scale described in the Section Group Awareness Tool.FindingsThere were no significant differences in the socio-demographic data, the Facebook use and the knowledge testprior to the intervention. Log data confirmed that all participants spent time looking at the graph as an indicationof reflecting upon it.CSCL 2015 Proceedings113© ISLSProcess analysisUsing an ANOVA with repeated measures (sessions 1 and 3-8), the process analysis showed a significant effectfor the interaction between time and epistemic quality, F(6;606)=3.81; p<.001; ηp2=.10, and between time andformal quality, F(6;606)=1.88; p=.015; ηp2=.053. Descriptive statistics also show that the epistemic quality didnot change in the control group throughout the semester but increased for both groups with argumentation script.The formal quality also only increased for argumentation script and decreased for the control group (Figure 2).Figure 2. Epistemic and formal quality of argumentsTo identify when the argumentative processes took shifted, we did simple contrasts comparing eachsession from the 3rd to the 8th time with the first session. On the epistemic dimension we found a decrease forthree groups from the first time of measurement to the third. Only the experimental group with argumentationscript increased the epistemic quality of their arguments. Until the fifth time of measurement all groups are closetogether and simple contrasts were not significant. Substantial and significant changes occurred from the first tothe sixth time of measurement, F(3;101)=5.70; p=.001; ηp2=.15, and all contrasts are significant until the end ofthe interventions. A similar process was observed on the formal quality of arguments. Descriptive statisticsshow that all groups are close until the fourth time of measurement, after that they diverged and simple contrastsare only significant between the first and the last time of measurement, F(3;101)=5.98; p=.001; ηp2=.15.Figure 3. Multi-perspective and goal-oriented communication attitudesUsing an ANOVA with repeated measures, we found significant main effects on communicationattitude change over the seminar period for both multi-perspective, F(8;800)=2.98; p=.003; ηp2=.03 and goaloriented dimensions, F(8;800)=14.2; p<.001; ηp2=.12, but no significant effect for the interaction between timeand group. Descriptive statistics also showed that attitudes increase on the multi-perspective dimension for theexperimental groups and independent from the groups. Simple contrasts showed a significant main effect for thefactor time from the first date of measurement to the second, F(3;100)=4.33; p=.04; ηp2=.04, and also thechanges from date one to eight and one to nine are significant, F(3;100)=5.38; p=.004; ηp2=.08 (Figure 3). TheCSCL 2015 Proceedings114© ISLSattitudes decrease on the goal-oriented dimension for all groups and simple contrasts are significant for thefactor time as of the fifth time of measurement until the last date, F(3;100)=16.58; p=.000; ηp2=.25.Knowledge outcomesWe found a significant effect for the experimental groups in domain-specific learning gains, F(3;102)=11.11;p<.001; ηp2=.25. Three participants did not take part in the final exam. The descriptive statistics show anincrease in learning gains from the control group to the experimental groups (Table 1).Table 1: Domain-specific knowledge, mean and standard deviationGroupControl(n=19)34.08 (6.53)M (SD)GAT(n=29)39.81 (5.42)ARG-Script(n=29)41.34 (4.38)GAT+ARG-Script(n=25)42.52 (4.33)Besides significant main effects for the two factors (GAT: F(1;98)=11.24, p=.001, ηp2=.10;Argumentation script: F(1;98)=23.44, p=.000, ηp2=.19), we also found a significant effect for the interactionbetween GAT and argumentation script, F(3;102)=4.89; p=.029; ηp2=.05.

Correlations between communication attitudes and learning outcomes are not significant.Conclusions and implicationsAs hypothesized, the GAT and the script guided learners to acquire more domain-specific knowledge andimproved learners' quality of arguments. The argumentation script seems to outperform the GAT with respect toboth of these variables. The combination of both instructional approaches shows the best results on all variables.Notably, the effect of GAT and script on the quality of arguments seems to set in only after 4-5 weeks of theseminar, indicating that it takes time to develop strategies for building high quality arguments and respectiveknowledge. By the same token, it may be very difficult in short-term interventions to raise quality of argumentsand even more difficult to increase domain-specific knowledge (Wecker & Fischer, 2014). It has been arguedthat learners are overwhelmed in short-term learning environments to consider both, the quality of argumentsand acquire domain-specific knowledge. Long-term interventions, in contrast, can realize AKC that facilitatesboth, argumentative and domain knowledge. Consequently, the relation between AKC processes and outcomesappears to develop over time.Learners' attitudes shifted on the multi-perspective dimension after the first seminar week from thebaseline to the second measurement time. Since the first intervention took place after the second measurementtime, the change from first to second time cannot depend on the two factors, but rather on the content of theseminar. The communication theories from the first session specifically address the multi-perceptivity ofunderstanding messages and the students were always instructed to reflect on the seminar theories while fillingout the communication attitude questionnaire. Over the entire seminar period, all experimental groups incl.CSCL 2015 Proceedings115© ISLScontrol group developed on the multi-perspective dimension. All groups declined on the goal-orienteddimension over time. While these attitude changes may derive from the seminar theories independent of GAT orscript, it goes to show that learning and attitude change are not linear processes. Over the seminar period therewere no significant differences between the groups, which is contrary to prior findings showing that groups withhigher coercion awareness tools surpassed groups with lower coercion awareness tools (Puhl et al., in review).This potentially means that interventions of group awareness and higher coercion (e.g. scripts that promptlearner’s to reflect on the visualized group awareness revealing conflictual ideas and attitudes) can ratherinfluence attitudes.This study extended CSCL research on scripts and group awareness tools to SNS. It thus providedinsights into long-term effects of these instructional approaches of CSCL. While these approaches do notproduce the expected short-term effects on domain-specific knowledge (Wecker & Fischer, 2014), this studyshows that such effects can still emerge in the long run.In contrast to popular views, SNS can serve as a platform for argumentation and learning. The resultsin this study reveal that learning to argue may take a social environment, in which groups develop sharedargumentative practices over time. SNS may offer themselves as such an environment. Two main directionsmay be taken from here. First, SNS can host long-term studies that can contribute to understanding andfacilitating argumentative learning in social communities. Second, massively used online fora like SNS offer thepossibility for technological interventions such as the ones investigated here. SNS may be leveraged to developpractices of argumentation on a large scale.ReferencesAndriessen, J. E. B. (2006). Arguing to learn. In K.
