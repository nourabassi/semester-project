Part of the popularity of social robots istheir ability to utilize social channels of communication to foster productive socialexperiences, interactions which help individuals grow and develop. Teachable robots havepotential to utilize social channels of communication to create social experiences which canhelp learners develop self-efficacy, an individual’s belief in their ability to succeed. In thispaper, we present a fully autonomous robot for middle school math; we iterate through threedesign phases and analyze responses to identify how to better foster productive socialexperiences for self-efficacy. We report six design recommendations; for example, for lowself-efficacy individuals, an ideal design should incorporate problem-solving statements andpositivity to foster social experiences of mastery and social persuasion.IntroductionIn this project, we investigate how robotic teachable agents can be designed to create social self-efficacyexperiences, or social interactions that may aid learners in improving their self-efficacy, their belief that theycan succeed in a domain. Teachable agents are agents that learners can teach about a subject domain (Chou,Chan, and Lin, 2003). When teaching others, learners attend more to the problem, reflect on misconceptionswhen correcting their peers’ errors, and elaborate on their knowledge as they construct explanations (Roscoeand Chi, 2007). Learning by teaching can improve domain knowledge (Kauchak and Eggen, 1993), self-efficacy(Frager and Stern, 1970), and peer attitudes (Griffin and Griffin, 1998).Implementing a teachable agent as a physical robot might enhance the learner’s social experience,which may then improve learning and motivation within a domain (Dillenbourg et al., 2016). Social factors playa strong role when learners teach agents. Those that feel invested in their agents’ learning (Leelawong andBiswas, 2008) or feel rapport with their agent (Ogan et al., 2012) are more likely to benefit. Because robots havea physical presence and rich channels of communication, they have under some circumstances developed adeeper social engagement with users than their virtual equivalent (Liu et al., 2013). The use of teachable robotsmay increase users’ social engagement and thus enhance the impact of social factors in learning by teaching.Our goal is to implement a teachable robot to improve learners’ self-efficacy. Self-efficacy, or belief inone’s ability to succeed, is a significant predictor of task performance (Bandura and Schunk, 1981). Selfefficacy in STEM plays a major role in learner persistence and success. However, it is not easy for learners todevelop self-efficacy. We aim to provide a learner with the following social experiences, theorized by Bandura(1977) to have positive effects on self-efficacy:1 Mastery experiences, facilitated by experiences where learners successfully teach the robot2 Vicarious learning experiences, where a social model exemplifies good learning practices3 Social persuasion, through social interaction learners are convinced of their success as domain expertsBandura further hypothesizes that a learner’s rapport, or sense of connection, with a collaborating partner, mightenhance the effects of these pathways. This suggests a fourth goal for our robot:4 Building rapport, or a feeling of connection, with the learnerIt is not clear how exactly a robot can be designed to achieve these goals. In this project, we examinethe design of social experiences within the context of a teachable robot for middle school mathematics, wherelearners teach the robot about ratio problems. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we present theimplementation of a fully autonomous teachable robot for mathematics, Nico. Nico is a Nao robot that caninteract with the learner using spoken dialogue and realistic gestures. The richness of Nico’s interactions makesit a unique platform for exploring social factors and effects on self-efficacy. Second, we present the results of amulti-phase iterative design process with 14 learners; through this process, we specifically explore how Nico’sdialogue can foster these social, self-efficacy experiences. We pose the following research questions:ICLS 2018 Proceedings737© ISLS•How do different dialogue design strategies based on human-human peer tutoring and theories ofrapport enhance mastery, vicarious experience, social persuasion, and rapport with a teachable robot?How might individual differences, such as initial self-efficacy, influence responses to differentdialogue design strategies in a teachable robot?Motivated by the literature on peer tutoring and rapport, we iterated on the design of Nico’s dialogue for eachsocial experience. We explored how Nico’s dialogue can facilitate mastery by balancing the challenge learnersface in articulating knowledge while enabling them to feel successful. We investigated how Nico’s dialogue canmodel different learning practices such as question-asking and optimism and spark a corresponding response inthe learner as vicarious experience. We explored both subtle and overt approaches to social persuasion.Finally, we explored rapport by iterating over rapport signaling behaviors of friends versus strangers. Weanalyzed learners’ responses in each phase, yielding six design recommendations with an emphasis on howdifferent individuals might benefit from different dialogue designs.•Prior workHuman-human peer tutoring literature indicates the importance of social factors and the presence of socialoutcomes in tutoring interactions. One meta-analysis suggests that peers who give help experience many socialand motivational benefits, including improved attitudes towards school, academic self-concept, and academicself-efficacy (Robinson et al., 2005). Recent work on peer tutoring has suggested the rapport between twocollaborating partners may correlate with learning outcomes (Ogan et al., 2012b). Madaio, Ogan, and Cassell(2016) found when tutees and tutors are friends, they engage in different tutoring strategies which may be moreproductive. These factors, if reproduced, may contribute to productive social experiences with a teachable robot.Our work is also inspired by the broader teachable agent literature, where learners teach a virtual agent.Teaching a computer agent can be beneficial for the learner doing the teaching: it can lead to more learning thanbeing taught by a computer agent (Leelawong and Biswas, 2008) and can be more effective than classroominstruction at improving learning and self-efficacy (Pareto et al., 2011). Chase and colleagues theorized thatthese benefits originate from the protégé effect, which occurs when learners become more motivated to teachtheir agent because: (1) they feel more responsible for their agent’s success and, (2) failures reflect on the agentrather than on them (Chase et al. 2009), and this may then facilitate learners experiencing greater mastery andsocial persuasion. Other human-agent work has suggested that the benefits of teachable agents come fromfeeling more rapport for an agent partner (Ogan et al., 2012a). Less work has focused on explicitly designinginteractions to promote social experiences. One exception is Gulz, Haake, and Silvervaarg (2011) whodemonstrate that adding off-task dialogue to a teachable agent can facilitate learning and positive outcomes.Despite the promise of teachable agents in general, there has only been a small body of prior work onteachable robots. Co-Writer is a Nao robot that learners teach about handwriting. Through adaptation of therobot’s learning behavior, studies have shown the robot can engage learners in the task and potentially promotemotivation and self-confidence (Jacq et al., 2016). Tanaka and Matsuzoe explored a Nao robot that learners canteach about vocabulary through physical demonstration (Tanaka and Matsuzoe, 2012). The interaction showedteaching a robot can support learning and suggested that both verbal and gestural communication is natural forteaching robots. rTAG is a Lego Mindstorms-based learning environment where learners teach the robotcoordinate geometry (Walker et al., 2016). rTAG explored how physical embodiment affects social engagement;social engagement increased in low prior knowledge learners but learning gains decreased. A subsequentiteration of rTAG known as Quinn explored the role of dialogue; Lubold and colleagues found a combination ofverbal and paraverbal social dialogue influenced perceptions of social presence (Lubold, Walker, and PonBarry, 2016). Collectively, this work indicates that teachable robots have potential to support learning, but therole of social factors remains unclear. In rTAG, physical embodiment alone was not enough to foster socialengagement, while mastery experiences in Co-Writer was. Quinn revealed verbal and paraverbal features mayenhance social experience but how dialogue can be designed to promote self-efficacy is an open question. Webuild on this prior work by introducing a fully autonomous teachable robot and exploring how empiricallymotivated, theoretically grounded dialogue can be designed to foster social experiences and self-efficacy.SystemWe have developed an autonomous teachable Nao robot for middle school mathematics named Nico. Inaddition to the Nao robot, our system includes a user interface (UI) and a dialogue system. The learning domainfor the teachable robot is middle school mathematics, specifically reasoning about ratios. We designed fournarrative-style ratio word problems for learners to teach Nico based on the Common Core Standards for 6thICLS 2018 Proceedings738© ISLSgrade. For each problem, Nico and the learner are given partial information; Nico requests the learner’s help inhow to use ratios to solve for the missing information. An example problem is depicted in Figure 1.Figure 1. Example of a problem as depicted in the user interface.Learners interact with Nico using spoken language and a touch-screen interface on a tablet computer(Microsoft Surface Pro) that displays each problem. The UI supports speech recognition and displays visualprogress as the learner moves through the problems. To speak to Nico, the learner presses a button on theinterface. After they are finished speaking, a notice appears on the interface indicating that Nico is ‘thinking’while the system processes the input and generates a response. Average response time is less than four seconds.The UI tracks progress as the learner guides Nico through each problem step at their own pace, using buttons toadvance forward. The current step is highlighted and enlarged on the screen. When Nico ‘answers’ a step, thecorresponding table cell is updated from question marks (see Figure 1) to the correct answer.The dialogue system is composed of an automatic speech recognizer, dialogue manager, and the Naorobot’s text-to-speech synthesizer. The interface captures the user’s speech using the tablet’s default microphoneand speech recognition is performed using the Google Speech API. We find an average word error rate of22.2%. Nico takes the initiative in the dialogue whenever a learner starts a problem, typically to request help.We utilize the Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML) (Wallace, 2003) to process the learner’s inputand identify Nico’s response. AIML is an XML-compliant pattern matching language. We designed anddeveloped the dialogue by mapping all possible solutions for each problem step to potential explanations. Aftera learner speaks, a potential explanation pathway is identified based on keywords in the speaker’s speech. If apotential explanation cannot be matched, Nico requests a clarification. For example, Nico might say “I’mactually not sure what you said. Can you try saying it again but differently?” Clarification requests occurred onaverage 4% of the time. The frequency of clarification requests did not differ substantially across design phases.In addition, we programmed Nico to produce eight emblematic or easily recognizable gestures.Gestures include waving ‘hello,’ nodding head as in ‘yes,’ shaking head ‘no,’ putting hands on hip to make apoint, raising either hand, raising hands in celebration, and shrugging. The dialogue manager identifies whetherthere is an appropriate gesture in the set to accompany Nico’s utterance. We also enabled ‘autonomous life’, adefault capability of the Nao robot which displays slight movement and listening behavior. Gesture andautonomous life were present in all phases. We do not explore gesture in the iterative design in this work, ratherfocusing on dialogue. The role of gesture in social, self-efficacy experiences is an opportunity for future work.Iterative designWith the platform described above, we can iterate over the design of a teachable robot’s dialogue and explore(1) how different dialogue design strategies might enhance mastery, vicarious experience, social persuasion, andrapport, and (2) the role of individual differences in response to different strategies.MethodFourteen participants between ages 10 and 13 (M: 11, SD: 1.0, 4 female/10 male) participated across threeexploratory design iterations with 5 participants (1 female/4 male) in the first phase, 5 (2 female/3 male)participants in the second phase, and 4 participants (1 female/3 male) in the final phase. All participants wereICLS 2018 Proceedings739© ISLSnative English speakers. Sessions lasted 90 minutes. Participants were recruited via flyers and emails sharedduring local programs offered to middle schoolers on the university campus.The procedure for each session was the same across all phases. Participants began by completing a 10minute pretest on ratios. Next, each participant was given a pre-survey on self-efficacy and comfort-leveltowards robots. Before interacting with Nico, participants were given a few minutes to review the worked-outsolutions to the problems they were to teach. Participants then watched a 3-minute video introducing Nico.After the video, Nico initiated a brief ‘introduction’ interaction by saying “Hello, it’s nice to meet you. What isyour name?” The ‘introduction’ gave participants an opportunity to practice talking to Nico before teaching.Participants utilized the tablet and spoken dialogue to teach Nico and moved through the problems at their ownpace. Time to complete teaching the problems varied from 12 to 35 minutes. After the interaction, participantscompleted a post-survey; twelve participants also took a 10-minute posttest (isomorphic to the pretest). We thenconducted structured interviews; the same questions were asked of every participant.To evaluate the design and impact of each phase, we collected self-reported measures of rapport, selfefficacy, and learning gains and performed a comparative analysis on the interviews, experimenter observations,and dialogue transcripts. For the self-reported rapport, we posed a set of 14 Likert scale questions about rapportto each participant. The questions were based on a combination of prior work exploring rapport in humanhuman (Tickle-Degnen and Rosenthal, 1990), human-agent (Cassell, Gill, and Tepper, 2007), and human-robotinteractions (Lubold, Walker, and Pon-Barry, 2016). Questions related to feelings of general rapport (i.e., “Nicoand I worked well together”), positivity (i.e., “I liked Nico, Niko liked me”), attention (“Nico paid attention tome”), and coordination (“I was awkward in talking to Nico”). We asked participants in post-interviews toexplain their understanding and interpretation of each survey question; these validations enabled small iterativechanges to improve the wording. We aggregated the questions for each participant into an average rapport score.Self-efficacy towards math was measured with six questions based on work by the Friday Institute forTechnology (2008). Participants answered the six questions both before and after interacting with Nico.Averaging the responses, we calculated whether participants experienced a change in self-efficacy as post-scoreminus pre-score. Additionally, we asked how comfortable individuals were interacting with robots and humanlooking robots. Finally, we calculated learning from the pre- and post-tests as a normalized learning gain score,as recommended in (Hake, 2002).We focused our qualitative analyses on the interviews, experimenter observations, and transcripts ofthe interaction dialogue. Since we are interested in identifying the degree to which the dialogue can influencesocial experience, we coded the data for themes regarding mastery experience, vicarious experience, socialpersuasion, and rapport. We identified a set of decision rules for identifying themes, as suggested by Miles,Huberman, and Saldana (1994). For example, for mastery to be present, the learner must give evidence they feelNico learned. An example decision rule for mastery was: participant is marked as having felt a degree ofmastery based on the presence of either (a) did the learner give any reference to Nico having ‘learned’ or (b) didthe learner mention any observations regarding Nico’s learning (i.e. “Nico said ‘I understand’ so he waslearning”). Two researchers compared and contrasted identified rules, themes and analyses to validateconsistency; findings were triangulated across all data to ensure all pieces were mutually supportive.Phase IIn Phase I, we began with dialogue which might foster mastery, vicarious experience, social persuasion andrapport based on human-human peer tutoring. To foster mastery, Nico challenged participants to explain eachstep thoroughly before reaching an understanding of the solution. To foster vicarious experience and socialpersuasion, we introduced a question-answer design based on human-human peer tutoring (Graesser andPerson, 1994) which found that tutees typically ask questions with low specificity. We designed Nico’s dialogueas approximately 80% questions with a tendency towards low specificity. In addition, Nico was responsive,giving a sense of paying attention by acknowledging answers to questions. To build rapport, we based thedialogue design on behaviors suitable to strangers in peer tutoring with an interest in whether it is better forNico’s dialogue to model that of a stranger or a friend. In human-human peer tutoring, tutees who are strangersask more questions and these questions tend to be shallow (Madaio, Ogan, and Cassell, 2016); tutors and tuteeswho are strangers are more polite (Ogan et al. 2012b). Nico’s dialogue already included questions; we furtherdesigned these to be shallow and more polite. Table 1 gives an example of the dialogue.Table 1: Example dialogue from each phase. In Phase I, Nico asks questions, is polite but slow to understand,and has low specificity. Phase II maintains the same level of questions and politeness but Nico is more specific,understands more quickly, and exhibits positivity. Phase III maintains the positivity and specificity of Phase IIbut Nico is less polite, asks fewer questions, and is slightly slower to understand than Phase IIICLS 2018 Proceedings740© ISLSPhase OneUser: Nico, first you’re going tolook at the ratio between the 6and the 2.

Now do we multiply 9by 2?User: Yeah exactlyNico: I get it. We put 6 over 2 equalto 9. And then what do wedo?User: Then you’re gonna crossmultiply 2 times 9.Nico: So then we multiply and thenwhat do we do?User: Yes so you’re gonna crossmultiply to get 18Nico: I get it; you’re so helpful!What do we do after we have18?User: Yeah cause you have tworatios so you can multiplyNico: Oh okay! So we can multiply.User: Yes so you’re gonna crossmultiply to get 18Nico: Sweet! So then we have 9times 2 is 18.Five participants took part in this phase, 4 males and 1 female. The results for the rapport, change inself-efficacy and qualitative observations are summarized in Table 2. We found that for mastery experiencefour of five participants in this phase were not convinced of Nico’s learning, reporting Nico only “kind oflearned” (P1, P2). We observed no evidence of vicarious experience. Participants’ did not appear to experienceor observe Nico’s model of question-asking and attention through responsiveness. The majority of theparticipants in this phase did not exhibit any form of social persuasion; they did not feel like Nico learned andalso felt that they were not successful as tutors. The one participant who felt like Nico learned did not attributeNico’s success to himself. P5 felt that Nico succeeded despite his own flaws as a tutor. Finally, participantswere largely neutral in the degree of rapport they felt for Nico. Few of the participants exhibited any sense ofgeneral rapport for Nico, and while participants responded in the interviews that while they ‘liked’ Nico (P1, P2,P3), Nico was still ‘a robot, not a person’ (P2, P3). Differences in verbal behaviors emerged; unlike the others,P5 praised Nico and was more inclusive.Individuals overall did not appear to be having productive social experiences; we found no evidence ofmastery, vicarious experience, social persuasion or rapport. We did find one participant with dissimilarresponses, which suggests individual differences play a pertinent role in these types of experiences.Phase IIIn our first design phase, we attempted to facilitate experience of mastery by challenging learners to explaineach step to Nico. However, they clearly did not experience mastery. It was possible the content of the problemsand act of tutoring is challenge enough; for Phase II, we increased the speed at which Nico understands and weincreased the level of specificity to see how this influences mastery. For vicarious experience, we kept thequestion-based design and responsiveness indicating attention but we explored whether other learning practicesmay be more suitable to vicarious experience with Nico. Positive social behavior during learning and stayingoptimistic in the face of challenging problems is correlated with learning outcomes (Pampaka, Williams, andHutcheson, 2012). We introduced positivity (i.e. “Oh okay! Great!”) and optimism (i.e. “these problems arehard but I think I’m getting it”) into Nico’s dialogue. For social persuasion, we had explored a subtle approachin Phase I; in Phase II, we introduced an overt design by framing messages to give outright encouragementsuccess as a tutor (i.e. “You’re so helpful!”). While these messages could be perceived as disingenuous,participants’ belief in themselves may be positively influenced. Finally, for rapport, ‘stranger-like’ behaviorsmay have been distancing but it was also possible there were too few dimensions of behavior. We incorporatedadditional rapport-building behaviors while maintaining a model consistent with that of a stranger. Individualswho are strangers may introduce more positivity when building rapport (Tickle-Degnen and Rosenthal 1990).Increasing Nico’s positivity to build rapport aligned with supporting vicarious experience and social persuasion.ICLS 2018 Proceedings741© ISLSTable 2: Summary of results and observations for each design phase; qualitative observations aggregate numberof decision rules met for all participants in a particular phase for a given social experience% of DecisionRules MetMasteryRapportVicariousExperienceSocialPersuasionSelfreportedrapport∆ in MathSelf-Efficacy0–20%Phase 13.52 (1.2).16 (.19)20–50%Phase 23.91 (1.2).50 (.20)50–75%75–100%Phase 34.67 (.29).68 (.17)Five participants took part in this design phase, 2 females and 3 males. We found an increased numberof participants (4 of 5) exhibited mastery, feeling Nico learned and that this learning was due to their tutoring.They noted that when Nico was specific, as in “Oh I guess we divide six by three?” (P7), they felt he waslearning from what they told him. We still did not see any acknowledgement from the participants of vicariousexperience; they did not comment on Nico’s question-asking, attention, or positivity and optimism. In terms ofsocial persuasion, while most of the participants in this phase felt Nico had learned, few felt they were “good”tutors. It is possible we over-simplified the process for explaining steps to Nico, leading learners to feel Nicowas just very smart, very intelligent, as one participant noted - “I didn’t explain it very well but he was reallysmart so he got it”. Also, P8 felt Nico’s praise, designed to socially persuade the learners, was “undeserved.”Finally, average rapport was higher in this phase. All five participants in post-interviews expressed higherengagement and two expressed feelings of accountability. These two learners also had the largest correspondingchanges in self-efficacy, and praised Nico, “Good job” and “Nice job.”In this second design phase, evidence of productive social experiences increased. More participantsexpressed a sense of mastery, higher social engagement, and behaviors expressive of rapport. However,experiences of social persuasion in the form of feeling responsible for Nico’s success and especially evidence ofvicarious experiences of good learning practices were not substantial.Phase IIIIn the second design phase, we observed positive responses to mastery. However, we also observed thatindividuals felt Nico was “very smart” and they did not experience social persuasion. The prior phase mayhave over-simplified the tutoring task in a way that could not be overcome by either subtle or overt persuasionand contributing to feelings that Nico’s praise was disingenuous. We re-adjusted the level of challenge requiredin explaining to Nico how to solve the problems where Nico is slightly slower to understand than in phase II.We also did not see substantial evidence of vicarious experience; for this phase, we decided to focus on howincreasing rapport might influence vicarious experience. For rapport in this final design phase, we emphasizedbehavior which would typically be found between friends rather than strangers. For example, Madaio, Ogan,and Cassell (2016) found that tutees who are friends tend to verbalize problem-solving statements more oftenthan asking questions. We modified Nico’s dialogue to incorporate statements about problem solving.For this final phase, we had four participants take part, 3 male and 1 female. Again, we found evidencethat participants experienced mastery, implying that slowing Nico’s understanding did not influence whetherparticipants felt like Nico learned. We did find evidence of vicarious experience. Participants commented onhow teaching Nico was like teaching a friend and three participants noted the positivity of Nico’s learningbehavior. For example, P11 stated that he “doesn’t get mad” and “Nico doesn’t get frustrated at you” (P13), hestays “positive.” Participants also noted Nico “doesn’t get distracted as people tend to do” (P13) and was a goodlistener (P12). All four participants in this phase gave evidence of feeling socially persuaded that they taughtNico. It was “because they explained it well that he understood it” (P11, P12, P13). In post interviews,participants’ comments reflected feelings of accountability in helping Nico learn as well. This phase had thehighest rapport compared to the two previous design iterations; participants commented Nico “reminds me ofmy friend,” is “pretty cool,” “funny,” and “cute.” Verbal behaviors when interacting with Nico showed two outof the four participants praised Nico. We find their use of praise similar to prior phases. However, oneparticipant gave Nico a little sass. (P13: “Thank you, Nico. Now get back to the questions!”)This iteration resulted in the most evidence of social experiences for enhancing self-efficacy.Participants continued to express a sense of mastery and high expressions of rapport. We finally saw evidencethat individuals vicariously experienced models of good learning practices, and individuals not only felt successin the task but they expressed feelings of responsibility for that success.ICLS 2018 Proceedings742© ISLSCross-phase trendsIn addition to qualitative observations, we measured rapport, self-efficacy, and learning. The average rapportand change in self-efficacy are summarized for each design phase in Table 2. While participants in differentdesign phases experienced different interactions, we explored cross-phase trends for insight into overall designdirections. We found a significant correlation (r = .71, p = .02, n = 10) between rapport (M = 4.0, SD = .9) andlearning gains (M = .47, SD = .2). We also found that rapport is significantly correlated with change in selfefficacy (M = .46, SD = .3) across all participants (r = .62, p = .03, n = 14). Change in self-efficacy was notcorrelated with learning gain (r = .46, p = .17, n = 10). These results support the theoretical argument that rapportis related to learning and self-efficacy and imply designing to enhance rapport may result in positive outcomes.We did not observe a correlation between self-efficacy and learning. While this may be due to theiterative design and the small sample size, it is possible the relationship is obscured by individual differences.Within each phase we observed a single individual who was very socially engaged, from their self-reportedrapport to their interview responses and verbal behaviors. Regardless of phase, these individuals praised Nicomore, included Nico in the learning process with inclusive language, and were more likely to anthropomorphizeNico. Viewing Nico as socially and cognitively capable, these learners had high social responses, a low bar forsocial experience, and higher gains. Comparatively, individuals with the lowest rapport and the lowest change inself-efficacy (P3, P6, and P8) responded to Nico with less inclusive language, little to no praise, and spoke ofNico as “the robot.” We found two other individuals, who interacted with Nico in phase III, reported initial selfefficacy scores as low as P3, P6, and P8; however, their change in self-efficacy was much higher. This suggeststhe third design phase may have been more effective for individuals with low self-efficacy.Discussion and conclusionIn this paper, we described Nico, a fully autonomous teachable Nao robot for mathematics learning that caninteract with learners using natural language. We explored through iterative design (1) how different dialoguedesign strategies can foster four social, self-efficacy experiences: mastery, vicarious learning, social persuasion,and rapport and (2) how individual differences influence responses to different dialogue design strategies. Ourfinal design, which yielded the highest self-reported feelings of self-efficacy and rapport, was the mostsuccessful at fostering these four experiences. It consisted of human-robot dialogue based on two humanlearners who are friends and introduced a moderate level of difficulty for achieving mastery experience. Overall,we find several interesting design suggestions:1. For mastery, dialogue design should provide the learner with the impression they are effective; if therobot reaches an answer too quickly, this reduces feelings of effectiveness. Design that incorporatesequal question-asking with problem-solving statements can facilitate mastery.2. For both vicarious experience and social persuasion, our analysis suggests if learners do not feeladequate rapport, they are less likely to have genuine social experiences and this will influence theiroverall self-efficacy. This implies initially focusing design on fostering rapport.3. To foster rapport, designing dialogue based on that of friends may produce stronger responses. We arenot suggesting designing a robot to act like a long-time friend from the first interaction but targetinginitial design strategies to incorporate ‘friend-like’ moves in initial interactions.4. Different dialogue designs interact with learners’ social predispositions and attitudes towards robots.Problem-solving statements, positivity, and high specificity may increase positive effects forindividuals who are less inclined to social interaction with robots and may help influence a positivechange in self-efficacy for these individual learners.5. For individuals with initially low self-efficacy, design for fostering social experiences is more critical.Individuals with initially high self-efficacy responded positively across all phases while individualswith initially low self-efficacy responded positively only to the third design phase.6. Gesture design should potentially differ depending on the learner’s initial level of self-efficacy. We didnot perform a full analysis of the design of gesture, keeping emblematic gestures and autonomous lifeconsistent. However, individuals with lower self-efficacy strongly disliked Nico’s autonomous lifemovement, while individuals with high self-efficacy preferred it.Moving beyond the specific design insights presented in this paper, we see Nico as a platform forexploring the larger space of design questions related to the effects of dialogue and gesture on social learningexperiences. This platform allows us to explore small variations in the design of dialogue and ultimately thecombination of dialogue and gesture that could have a large impact on learning and motivation, through thecreation of social experiences which can help learners develop self-efficacy.ICLS 2018 Proceedings743© ISLSReferencesBandura, A., & Schunk, D.
