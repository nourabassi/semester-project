People tend to treat not only themselves but also others withinthe scope of the stereotypes that they experienced. Stereotypical conceptions about certainsubjects and occupations are formed in early life. The cycle of stereotype threats could bebroken by exposing early childhood pre-service teachers to robotics that requires them tobuild and program robots and design of mathematics lessons using robots.IntroductionThis paper reports on pre-service early childhood teachers’ learning with robotics for teaching. Specifically,their integration of robotics into mathematics teaching in their lesson designs was examined. Their perceptionsof gender stereotype threats were also examined. This paper is aligned with CSCL’s “Strand 2: Access andEquity in High Quality Knowledge” in that it reports a study in which computer-supported collaborativelearning was facilitated through group robot assembly, programming, and lesson designs, with the ultimate goalof improving gender equity in early childhood education.Relevant literatureMost efforts to boost science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) career interest focus onmiddle and high school (George, Neale, & Van Horne, 2001; Olson & Riordan, 2012; Tyson, Lee, Borman, &Hanson, 2007). While such settings are important, if one waits until middle and high school to addressintentions to pursue STEM career pathways, it may be too late (Ralston, Hieb, & Rivoli, 2013). For example,career interest at an early age critically influences life-long decisions (Archer et al., 2013; Maltese & Tai, 2010).Occupational aspirations tend to be stable during adolescence and earlier aspirations determine career choiceand pursuit of educational opportunities (Rojewski & Yang, 1997).Stereotypical conceptions about certain subjects and occupations are formed in early life (Tuijl &Molen, 2016), and can cause members of underrepresented groups to attribute poor performance to such ideasas “girls can’t be good at math” (Appel & Kronberger, 2012; Cvencek, Meltzoff, & Greenwald, 2011; Thoman,Smith, Brown, Chase, & Lee, 2013). Elementary school girls, 2 nd graders, identified themselves with math lessthan boys (Cvencek et al., 2011). Attributing failure to such factors can lead to low self-efficacy, because suchstudents see their failure as resulting from a stable cause (e.g., gender, ethnicity; Weiner, 1985). Before studentsare “locked in to a particular orientation toward occupations”, the effort to create optimal environments isneeded during elementary years (Rojewski & Kim, 2003, p. 140).Central to this effort is a need to prepare pre-service early childhood teachers to provide successopportunities in STEM for all students. Teacher beliefs and expectations influence students (Jussim & Harber,2005). Female students are not included in the high math performer group as many as male students are, fromkindergarten to eighth grade (Robinson & Lubienski, 2011). Female students were 15% of the top 1% inkindergarten and 37% of the top 1% and 40% of the top 10% in eighth grade. Such persistent gender disparityseems related to teachers’ gender stereotype that impacts their beliefs about math ability and efforts of lower toaverage achieving students (Tiedemann, 2002). Without these lower to average math achieving students’moving close to the top, females would continue to be part of the underrepresented group in STEM careers(Robinson & Lubienski, 2011).Preparing early childhood pre-service teachers to be positive role models to young girls can help. Onestrategy that can lower stereotype threat is exposing students to positive role models who contradict stereotypes(Marx & Goff, 2005; Marx & Roman, 2002). Positive role models who are female and competent in math andother STEM-related skills can help young girls “buffer their self-appraised math ability” (Marx & Roman, 2002,p. 1183).The current study exposed early childhood pre-service teachers, all female, to robotics and help themteach mathematics with robots. People tend to treat not only themselves but also others within the scope of theCSCL 2017 Proceedings617© ISLSstereotypes (Thoman et al., 2013). When early childhood pre-service teachers consider themselves as a nonmath person because they are female (Kim et al., 2015), such a stereotype could be modeled by young girls intheir future classroom. The cycle of gender stereotype threats could be broken by exposing early childhoodfemale pre-service teachers to robotics that requires them to build and program robots and design of mathlessons using robots.Robotics was chosen because it has shown to promote STEM interest and learning and has been usedin teacher education (e.g., Sullivan & Moriarty, 2009). However, it has been rarely used in preparing earlychildhood teachers to teach STEM despite the potential benefits of robotics for young children (Bers, Flannery,Kazakoff, & Sullivan, 2014). Especially, teaching mathematics with robotics has not been developed as much asscience, technology, and engineering (Silk, Higashi, Shoop, & Schunn, 2009). Mathematical connections areoften overlooked among teachers in teacher preparation contexts using robotics (Kim et al., 2015).Research questionsIn this study, the following research questions were addressed:1. How do the early childhood pre-service teachers design robotics in mathematics teaching?2. How do the early childhood pre-service teachers perceive stereotypical threats?MethodsResearch designThe study employed qualitative research design using open-coding, thematic analysis, and content analysis(Creswell, Clark, & Gutmann, 2003).ParticipantsParticipants were eleven early childhood pre-service teachers enrolled in an undergraduate course for hands-onlearning in early childhood education. They engaged in robotics for four weeks as part of the course curriculum(see Figure 1). All were female and had no experience with robotics and programming prior to the study. Theresearch site was a public university in the United States.Figure 1. Collaborative Robot Building.Data collection and analysisData sources were lesson designs and semi-structured interviews. To address RQ1, content analysis wasconducted in seven lessons collaboratively designed by the participants. We examined the grade levels and mathcontent addressed, the methods and affordances of robotics use, and collaborations designed for students. The 4researcher team discussed lesson analysis strategies, one experienced researcher analyzed one lesson and sharedit with the team, the team discussed the analysis, two other researchers analyzed the rest, and the team againdiscussed and revised their analysis where needed. In addition, interviews were analyzed to examineparticipants’ mathematics teaching with robots. To address RQ2, interviews were analyzed. Nine out of elevenparticipants were interviewed for 20-30 minutes each. The statements (e.g., “Males are much more talented inmath than females”) used to assess one’s stereotype threats in the literature such as Mayer and Hanges (2003),Picho and Brown (2011), and Tiedemann (2002) were applied to construct a coding scheme (e.g., situationspecific stereotypes, generalized stereotypes) in identifying and analyzing participants’ comments frominterview transcripts. For example, such comments as “I’m not great at math… but I like reading” wereidentified first and a thematic analysis was conducted to record themes (Miles & Huberman, 1984) related tostereotype threats.ResultsCSCL 2017 Proceedings618© ISLSThe grade levels targeted in lessons ranged from kindergarten to fourth grade: 2 lessons for kindergarten, 1lesson for first grade, 2 lessons for second grade, and 2 fourth grade. Participants were allowed to target upperelementary levels. Participants were not required to include mathematics. Among seven mathematics lessons,five were interdisciplinary, integrating science, art, and language arts into mathematics teaching. Mathematicscontent included force and measurement, geometry shapes, friction and measurement, counting numbers andmeasuring distance, and different types of terrain and measurement. The common mathematics content wasmeasurement and geometric shapes. These content utilized robotics affordances such as (a) robots can beprogrammed to execute specific commands and (b) a robot travels with different speeds on different surfaces,which lends itself to measuring distances and representing the data. The following two comments illustrateparticipant reasoning for their mathematics content selection.We picked mathematics. We thought we could incorporate that [mathematics] with the[robot] building, but then when we looked more into second grade [mathematics]standards, that wasn’t really a second grade standards, and we saw that they did a lotof graphing, so we thought they could do time trials with the robot and stuff, and wethought that, with it, that would be, like, gateway into robotics, just graphing. It wassomething that they would be familiar with, and they could tie that together with theirrobots.Especially with kindergarten because they’re not really, they don’t really know how towrite and read, and math isn’t really their strongest suit, so I think shapes was... agood, artistic way to pull them in.Students collaborated in these lessons by measuring the distances robots run and recording data, editingtheir peers’ writings on their observations of the distances robots running along different slopes, talking abouttheir favorite parts of the robotics activities they performed in the class, programming robots, writing robotstories, building a town with trails for robots to travel on, and making hypothesis of a robot running on trailsbuilt with different materials.The interview data analysis results with regard to stereotype threats reveal that participants frequentlyacknowledged their lack of knowledge of STEM, resulting from (a) no talent in mathematics and (b) noexposure to STEM growing up. For example, one participant said, “I’m not great at math… but I like reading.”This remark seemed to imply that, to like reading, you can just like reading without being good, but to likemath, you have to be a math (talented) person. In addition, the following comments illustrate that female preservice early childhood teachers in this study were exposed to the learning experience that has helped themmore self-efficacious about STEM than ever before:I never really knew much about STEM growing up and everything. And then I wasn’treally into technology and stuff like that, but [now I’ve done robot assembly andprogramming] it’s not as hard as someone who doesn’t know about it thinks that it is.DiscussionData analysis results will be presented in detail during our presentation.ReferencesAppel, M., & Kronberger, N.
