Focusing on 11th-grade students from China, this study showed that parentoriented goals were strongly associated with performance-avoidance goals while social statusgoals were strongly associated with mastery goals. Students’ parent-oriented goals had a directeffect on SRL strategy use, while social status goals had an indirect effect on SRL strategy usethrough mastery goals.IntroductionSelf-Regulated Learning (SRL) has attracted increasing attention due to its significance in predicting academicsuccess. SRL refers to a proactive learning process that encompasses motivation, metacognition, and strategy use(Zimmerman, 1990). Parent-oriented goals and social status goals are commonly endorsed social-academic goals,especially among the Chinese students. However, there is a dearth of research that has investigated the direct andindirect ways that social-academic goals may influence SRL. Informed by the hierarchical model of achievementmotivation (Elliot, 1999), social-academic goals are posited as antecedents of achievement goals through whichsocial-academic goals further influence the use of SRL strategies.MethodsParticipantsTwo groups of students participated in the study. The first sample was 449 students in Shanghai. The secondsample was 553 students in Jiangxi.MeasuresParent-oriented goals were assessed with 12 items developed by Cheung and Pomerantz (2012). Social statusgoals were assessed with six items adapted from Dowson and McInerney (2004)’s Goal Orientation and LearningStrategies Survey (GOALS-S). These items assess students’ purpose to obtain or maintain social status at presentor in the future. Academic achievement goals were assessed with 14 items adapted from the Patterns of AdaptiveLearning Skills (PALS) (Midgley et al., 2000). SRL strategy use was assessed with 22 items (Rao & Sachs, 1999).Two types of SRL strategies were assessed: 13 items on cognitive learning strategies and nine items on selfregulation.ProcedureAll the items were scored on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The firstauthor administered the questionnaire, requiring participants to complete in around 15 minutes.ResultsConfirmatory factor analysisFirst, after checking the univariate normality of variables, we posited a five-factor model comprised of mastery,performance-approach, performance-avoidance, social status, and parent-oriented goals. For the models in bothareas, the majority of factor loadings were higher than .60, except two items were higher than .50.Descriptive statistics and correlation analysesCorrelations for the Shanghai sample and the Jiangxi sample are presented below the diagonal and above thediagonal respectively (see Table 1). Parent-oriented goals and social status goals were positively correlated. Thetwo kinds of social-academic goals both had positive correlations with achievement goals. More specifically, inboth areas, parent-oriented goals were mostly associated with performance-avoidance goals, which followed byperformance-approach goals, and lastly mastery goals.ICLS 2018 Proceedings1351© ISLSTable 1： Correlations among the Central Constructs (N = 1002)1Variable1.

Nevertheless, the modelfit was considered reasonable according to other indexes: RMSEA = .06, CI = .06, .07, GFI = .92, CFI = .94, TLI= .92. Concerning social-academic goals’ effects on achievement goals, social status goals significantly predictedmastery goals (γ = .504, p < .001), performance-approach goals (γ = .206, p < .001), and performance-avoidancegoals (γ = .150, p < .001). Parent-oriented goals significantly predicted performance-approach goals (γ = .391,p < .001) and performance-avoidance goals (γ = .451, p < .001). But parent-oriented goals did not havesignificant effect on mastery goals. Regarding the direct effect of these goals on academic engagement, masterygoals positively predicted SRL strategy use (β = .416, p < .001), which followed by parent-oriented goals (γ =.205, p < .001).Figure1.
