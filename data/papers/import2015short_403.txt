Learning Resilience in the Face of Bias: Online Gaming, ProtectiveCommunities and Interest-Driven Digital LearningGabriela T. Richard, University of Pennsylvania, gric@upenn.eduChristopher Hoadley, New York University, tophe@nyu.eduAbstract: Online digital gaming environments have been proposed as an important form ofcomputer-supported collaborative learning, but these environments have been shown tomarginalize some learners, most notably women or girls, as well as ethnic or racial minorities.Furthermore, game-based competencies and identities have been shown to be important fordigitally-mediated learning activities and trajectories in computer science and technology. Inthis paper we look at how supportive communities can improve resilience by mitigatingstereotype threat, and thereby helping to protect vulnerable groups from the negative effects ofimplicit and explicit bias in gaming culture and game-based learning activities. Our findingsdemonstrate that a female-supportive gaming community can foster equitable gamingidentification and self-concept, and we propose that similar models can be used with othermarginalized groups (i.e., ethnic/racial minorities).Keywords: online gaming, digital games, gender, race, ethnicity, stereotype threat, social identitytheory, communities of practice, informal learning, interest-driven learning, 21st century learningIntroductionGaming has often been cited as inequitable in its social practices, particularly for females. In an era whereinformal learning spaces and communities are increasingly contributing to meaningful skill development,domain identification and learning trajectories, understanding the ways these spaces can be inclusive to certainlearners and marginalizing to others becomes increasingly important in meeting equity goals. This paper buildsoff of previous work that explores the interrelationship between social experiences in online gaming and itseffects on the investment, self-perceptions of domain competency (i.e., gaming ability), and the social practicesof gamers, across gender (Richard, 2013a; Richard & Hoadley, 2013). Specifically, we focus on the role thatonline gaming communities play as a form of computer-supportive collaborative learning.We begin by focusing on the mitigating and mediating negative social practices in online spaces, andhow supportive communities can be protective for vulnerable players (namely, female and ethnic minorityplayers). We first examine how gaming activities can support learning, as well as marginalize certainsociocultural identities. We then explore the relationship amongst community perceived support, gamingidentification and gaming self-concept to see how identity supportive participation structures can play a role infostering resiliency against stereotype threat for marginalized groups (i.e., whether female-supportivecommunities can level the playing field for women). Finally, we discuss the findings in light of creatinginclusive and equitable spaces for computer supported collaborative learning.Gaming communities as spaces of learning and practiceLiterature continues to demonstrate that digital, mediated and online spaces offer opportunities for learning anddeveloping interest-driven competencies, and emerging and necessary 21st century literacies (e.g., Gee, 2004;Halverson, 2012; Hayes & Duncan, 2012; Ito, et. al, 2010; Jenkins, Clinton, Purushotma, Robinson & Weigel,2006; Kafai, Peppler & Chapman, 2009; Squire, 2011; Thomas & Brown, 2011). Much has been written abouthow “affinity” spaces can not only be models for education through interest-driven learning within authenticcontexts, but can also serve as learning environments themselves where applied and authentic expertise formsthrough learning with others (e.g., Gee, 2004; Hayes & Duncan, 2012). Increasingly, online multiplayer gameenvironments are being used as exemplary models of authentic learning communities from which motivationcan be fostered (e.g., Dickey, 2007), and collaborative and constructivist learning has been documented (e.g.,Squire, 2011; Steinkuehler, 2004; Steinkuehler & Duncan, 2008; Voulgari & Komis, 2010).Capitalizing on gaming communities as learning spaces raises questions about who can benefit fromsuch spaces. Access across gender, in particular, is an area of concern that has been raised over the past 30 years(e.g., Bryce & Rutter, 2003; Kiesler, Sproull & Eccles, 1985; Yee, 2008). Researchers have, on the one hand,looked to the motivation games produce as a potential technique to engage learners. But, on the other hand,researchers have also noted the wide disparity of who is present in these game-based affinity spaces as theycurrently exist. In the next section, we explore the issue of gender and access to gaming.CSCL 2015 Proceedings451© ISLSGames, gender and marginalizationEarly work that sought to understand why women or girls were not playing and participating as much or in thesame way as men or boys thought game themes were male-oriented, and felt that females wanted less difficultgames or more whimsical themes (e.g., Morlock, Yando & Nigolean, 1985; Wilder, Mackie & Cooper, 1985).Related work proposed that females and males have different learning styles and prefer certain design elements,a popular concept shared by many game designers (e.g., Braithwaite & Shreiber, 2009; Ray, 2004; Schell, 2009).Later work examined more culturally constructed models of gender in the context of gaming (e.g., girls havebeen taught to like certain games) citing the influence of culture, access and experience (e.g., Carr, 2005;Dickey, 2006; Taylor, 2008).If gaming is to be used as a context for promoting learning (whether technology-oriented learning ormore self-directed learning as with affinity spaces), we certainly should consider both the differences of learnersacross different sociocultural experiences, along with overarching cultural assumptions. But, these issues maynot be the most important factor in determining who has equitable access to these learning spaces. As assertedby Lave and Wenger (1991), learning in communities of practice is contingent on power relations. Similarly,related research (e.g., Goode, 2010; Margolis & Fisher, 2002) has documented the role that differentialgendered expectations and support around computing – including playful experimentation fostered throughgaming (Cassell & Jenkins, 1998; Kiesler, Sproull & Eccles, 1985) - from early ages and beyond contribute tothe gender gap in computing and technology. This bears the question of whether women and girls are able todevelop identities of learning within the power dynamics of gaming culture.A long line of research on gender and games demonstrates that females often don’t have the sameefficacy as males when it comes to digital games and game culture. However, newer research is finding thatgender differences in abilities and perceived abilities were often diminished once females had the opportunity totrain and engage in gaming (e.g., Feng, Spence & Pratt, 2007; Jensen & deCastell, 2011). Furthermore, researchhighlights that the ways games and game marketing portray the social context around gender and ethnicity canhave measurable, negative effects on players’ sense of who belongs in gaming and virtual environments, whichoften precludes women and girls (e.g., Behm-Morawitz & Mastro, 2009) and racial or ethnic minorities (Dill &Burgess, 2012). Similarly, lack of diversity and representation can have similar effects on efficacy formarginalized gamers (e.g., Lee & Park, 2011). Research also demonstrates that females and racial/ethnicminorities are likely to have lowered domain self-concept when presented negative stereotypes or marginalizedrepresentations of their respective groups, which is often the case (e.g., Behm-Morawitz & Mastro, 2009;Williams, Martins, Consalvo & Ivory, 2009). For example, Williams, et. al. (2009) found that male charactersand White characters, respectively, each made up over 85% of primary characters, and many game types did nothave any representational diversity.Furthermore, most play spaces, in the home or in public gaming environments (e.g., the arcade orgaming conventions), are often structured around gender dynamics, such that males were given more agency todemonstrate their abilities and authority (e.g., Bryce & Rutter, 2003; Kiesler, Sproull & Eccles, 1985). Onlinespaces are similarly mediated by male experience (Yee, 2008), which forces some females to hide their genderwhen playing online. However, this is increasingly difficult with the rise of voice-based gaming communication(Richard, 2013b; Gray, 2012) and profile stalking, the act of looking up ones’ online identity (Richard, 2014).Recent work has found that females as well as ethnic/racial minorities are often victims of harassment (Gray,2012; Richard, 2013c; Richard, 2014) and females are three times more likely to experience harassment whenusing voice-based chat online regardless of skill (Kuznekoff & Rose, 2013). All of these factors show supportthat online gaming may negatively affect the amount of investment and self-concept female and ethnic minorityplayers have with gaming, as well as their ability to engage equitably in online social play.Mechanisms of marginalizationBoth stereotype threat (Steele & Aronson, 1995; Steele, 1997) and social identity theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1986;Eccles, 2005) address how identities form in relation to sociocultural experiences, which can support or inhibitidentification with certain fields, domains and aspirations. Stereotype threat, in the short term, can cause stressfor individuals stereotyped to underachieve in a domain, which limits their working memory and inhibits theirperformance when triggered. It can be triggered overtly (e.g., through harassment) or ambiguously (e.g., maleoriented themes or advertising). Over time, stereotype threat and unsupportive learning climates can lead todomain disidentification (Steele, 1997; Picho & Stephens, 2012). For example, groups frequently stereotypedwith underperformance in math or science will eventually disidentify with that area, and choose not to engage inrelevant learning and performance activities (Hill, Corbett & St. Rose, 2010; Steele, 1997; Spencer & Aronson,2002). In studies where stereotype threat was measured in computer and technology environments, researchersfound that females were more likely to attribute failure to their own technical inabilities than males in generalCSCL 2015 Proceedings452© ISLSand females not in a stereotype threatening situation (Koch, Muller & Sieverding, 2008). Researchers havefound that marginalized gamers are more likely to not identify with gaming, and efforts for targetedrepresentation don’t rectify this issue (Shaw, 2012). For most marginalized gamers, the exclusivity of gameculture seems to be a greater barrier (Richard, 2013b; Shaw, 2012).In other words, when we see studies that highlight female distaste and eventual disidentification withcomputer and technology careers and interest-driven trajectories (e.g., Anderson, Lankshear, Timms &Courtney, 2008), we may be witnessing the byproduct of both culturally constructed dissonance and stereotypethreat disidentification. Essentially, these kinds of studies highlight the interrelationship between context andidentification with competencies and associated careers. In short, it may be that there is gender inequity inonline games due first to sociocultural practices (i.e., male-oriented design, and differential female support toplay), and then the harassment and marginalization that results due to the incongruence between social identitiesand expectations in the play space, which can both invoke stereotype threat. This, then, causes females todisidentify and either leave the domain or to face difficult compromises such as self-misrepresentation(pretending to be male), disidentification with their marginalized stereotype (disidentifying as female), orsimply enduring mistreatment. In fact, Richard (2013a) found that stereotype threat vulnerability is indeedhigher for females and ethnic/racial minorities in digital gaming.Figure 1. Logic Model of how environmental factors affect identification, self-concept and interest-drivenlearning trajectories, as well as the role of protective environments and resiliency in mitigating those outcomes.Supportive spaces and fostering resiliencyNot all individuals will be subjected to or similarly vulnerable to stressors (like stereotype threat) or positiveinfluences. However, researchers caution that, even though most individuals exhibit strong resiliency against allodds, positive role models and environments are especially important in mitigating negative stressors andresulting negative outcomes for vulnerable groups (Benard, 2004). Protective environments have been found tohave “particular importance when adversity levels are high” (Werner, 2013, p.99). Positive educational climatesand teachers have been found especially helpful because they serve as sources of support and role models forlearners, sometimes in place of other caring structures or individuals (Benard, 1993).Protective processes have been seen to “counteract the harmful effect of stressors (such as educatorsproviding normative coping strategies for students during school transitions...)” and protective enhancingprocesses strengthen an individual’s capacity to manage stressors on their own (Reyes, Elias, Parker &Rosenblatt, 2013, p. 351). Since protective environments and interventions can only extend so far, aidingindividuals in developing their own coping strategies has been seen as especially useful for long-term outcomesbeyond the supportive structure or intervention (Werner, 2013).To summarize, interest-driven and informal learning operates within sociocultural context, which canshape the kinds of learning trajectories individuals will eventually invest and partake in, as outlined in figure 1.One successful approach to leveling the playing and learning field is to train people to be resilient and provideboth safe havens and skills that allow individuals to resist the negative effects of stressors.Supportive community as a model of interest-driven learning and resiliencyIn this study, we further explore a longstanding explicitly female-supportive (yet co-ed) gaming community,named PMS Clan. Our work (Richard, 2014; Richard, 2013a; Richard & Hoadley, 2013) underscored the levelof investment required by this community. While skill is not a requirement to join, many members train withhighly skilled players who compete in tournaments, and can go on to compete in tournaments, or just play withCSCL 2015 Proceedings453© ISLSthe community in low-stakes online matches during practices. Telling of its success with this model, femalemembers of this community are some of the most visible females in the professional gaming circuit. As furtherdiscussed in Richard (2014), community structures reinforced learning as central to the community, through itshighly regulated practices and emphasis on bettering skills and mastery. Members must practice and play withthe community at least four hours a week.However, participating in the community is also a tale of resiliency. As a central component of thecommunity’s mission, and a regular part of practice activities when playing in the community together onlineagainst random opponents, members are taught to cope with the kinds of regular and negative behavior they aresubjected to. As part of membership, individuals not only are required to be respectful and supportive ofmarginalized groups (females, ethnic minorities and LGBTQI players) but are also taught to be good sports inthe face of adversity, and use their fellow members as sources of venting and support after matches (see,Richard, 2014). In this sense, the community serves a protective process and protective-enhancing process.MethodIn past studies, we found (Richard & Hoadley, 2013) that members of this female-supportive communityexhibited higher gaming identification and self-concept than members of other communities. Female and malemembers in the female-supportive community were equal in their gaming identification (in other communities,gaming identification was significantly higher for males than females). Here, we seek to further understand therelationship between communities, and their structures on members’ identification and sense of ability.Specifically, what is the role of member perceived support, and community structures, and which is the bestpredictor? The research questions explore herein are: What is the relationship between community perceivedsupport, gaming self-concept and gaming identification? If the possible effect of community is controlled for,can community perceived support predict gaming self-concept and gaming identification?MeasuresThe survey was one part of a larger, mixed-methods study (with surveys, interviews and ethnographicparticipant observation) on gaming experience, online communities, and learning-relevant outcomes conductedprimarily between 2009-2012 (Richard, 2013a). The two measures reported here were derived from thePerceived community support questionnaire (PCSQ) (Herrero & Gracia, 2007) and the Social Identities andAttitudes Scale (SIAS) (Picho & Brown, 2011). The PCSQ is made up of three scales, which assess threeaspects of community support. Community integration measures sense of belongingness and identification to acommunity, community participation measures how much one is involved in social activities in the community,and community organization measures the degree of support a respondent perceives. Items were measured on a5-point Likert scale from (1) strongly disagree to (5) strongly agree. Only two measures from the SIAS areanalyzed in this study: domain (gaming) identification and self-concept. Both of these measures were used inpast studies to assess the role of communities in shaping identification and self-concept, across gender. ThePCSQ was revised slightly to reflect gaming communities instead of general community organizations, and toaccount for some wording that didn’t make sense in translation from Spanish. The original scale demonstratedgood internal consistency for the overall scale (α > .85) and its subscales (α > .75). Reliability analysis was runfor the revised PCSQ, which demonstrated high internal consistency for the overall scale (α = .92) and itssubscales for community integration (α = .76), community participation (α = .86) and community organization(α = .84).Participants and contextParticipants were self-identified game players, 18 or older (due to human subjects constraints), who responded tocalls for participation, widely disseminated across several gaming communities, including the female-supportiveone, and some social networks associated with the researchers’ institution, located in the Northeastern UnitedStates.Data analysisThe Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the relationship between perceivedcommunity support, gaming self-concept and gaming identification for female-supportive community (FSC) ascompared to other communities, since the FSC demonstrated higher levels of gaming self-concept andidentification in general over other communities in previous analyses (Richard & Hoadley, 2013). Preliminaryanalysis were performed to ensure that there weren’t violations of the underlying assumptions of normality,linearity and homoscedasticity. Results demonstrate that for individuals in communities other than female-CSCL 2015 Proceedings454© ISLSsupportive one, the PCSQ has a significant positive relationship with gaming identification (r = .33, n = 39, p =.04); the subscale community participation has a significant positive relationship with gaming identification (r =.33, n = 39, p = .04) and gaming self-concept (r = .34, n = 39, p = .04); and the subscale communityorganization has a significant positive relationship with gaming identification (r = .36, n = 39,p = .02). Therewere no significant relationships between the PCSQ or its subscales in the FSC. Table 1 contains the Pearsonproduct-moment correlations, divided by community membership, across gaming identification, gaming selfconcept, the PCSQ and its subscales.Table 1: Correlations, divided by community membershipMeasureGaming IdentificationGaming Self-ConceptPCSQCommunity IntegrationCommunity ParticipationCommunity OrganizationFemale Supportive (FSC)	  1234- .42***0.220.130.002 -0.04.88***-	  	  Other communities50.230.05.89***.63***-60.18-0.04.81***.75***.51***-1-2.76 ***-3.33*.32*-40.170.26.83***-5.32*.34*.93***.62***-6.36*0.17.88***.70***.71***-* p < .05, ** p < .01, *** p < .001 (2-tailed)The correlations demonstrated that perceived community support, as measured with the PCSQ, has asignificant positive relationship with gaming identification, particularly for members of communities other thanthe female supportive one. Further, the subscale community participation and gaming self-concept had asignificant positive relationship for members of communities other than the FSC. However, there appeared to beno significant relationship between perceived community support and gaming identification or self-concept formembers of the female-supportive community. As a result, we found it important to investigate whethercommunity perceived support predicted gaming identification or self-concept over and above communitymembership.A hierarchical linear regression was first run on gaming identification (table 2), which previouslydemonstrated the strongest positive relationship with the PCSQ and its subscales, with community membership(FSC or other community) put in the model first, followed by the subscales of the PCSQ. Using Cohen’s (1998)criteria, the table of correlations show that gaming identification has a medium positive correlation with thefemale-supportive community membership (r = .42, n = 103, p <.0001). The table of correlations furthershowed that community participation and community organization had small positive correlations with gamingidentification, r = .26, n = 103, p <.01, and r = .27, n = 103, p <.01, respectively. There wasn’t a significantcorrelation between community integration and gaming identification, r = .04, n = 103, p <.35.Community membership was entered in step 1 and explained 17.7% of the variance in gamingidentification, F (1, 101) = 21.68, p < .0001. After entering the subscales of the PCSQ into the model in step 2,the total variance explained by the model increased to 26.6%, F (3, 98) = 8.86, p <.0001. Examining the changein the model, it is evident that the addition of the PCSQ subscales explained an additional 8.9% of the variance,R square change = .89, F change (3, 98) = 3.95, p= .01 (see table 2). However, in the final model, onlycommunity membership was statistically significant (beta = .36, p < .0001), though community participation(beta = .22, p= .057), and community organization (beta = .24, p = .07) were reaching significance. Based onthe results, we can conclude that perceived community support doesn’t statistically significantly contribute togaming identification after controlling for the influence of community. In other words, community membershipcontributes more significantly to gaming identification than perceived community support within thecommunity does.A hierarchical linear regression was then run using the same process on gaming self-concept (see table2), by first entering community membership in step 1 followed by the subscales of perceived communitysupport. The table of correlations show, once again, that gaming self-concept has a small positive correlationwith female-supportive community membership (r = .27, n = 103, p <.01). It also further shows that communityparticipation has a small yet positive correlation with gaming self-concept (r = .17, n = 103, p = .04). FSCmembership was first entered into the model in step 1 and explained 7.4% of the variance in gaming selfconcept, F (1, 101) = 8.01, p < .01. After entering the subscales of the PCSQ into the model in step 2, thevariance explained increased to 10.2%. However, while the model as a whole is significant, F (3, 98) = 2.8, p =.03, the change in R square is not, indicating that the subscales of the PCSQ do not explain the additionalCSCL 2015 Proceedings455© ISLSvariance in gaming self-concept, R square change = .03, F change (3, 98) = 1.03, p = .38. In other words, thesubscales of the PCSQ do not add significantly to gaming self-concept, after controlling for gaming communitymembership. Gaming community membership remains the stronger predictor of gaming self-concept, thoughthe entire model only explains a small amount of the variance.Table 2: Left: Linear model of predictors of gaming identification, with 95% confidence intervals in parenthesis.Right: Linear model of predictors of gaming self-concept, with 95% confidence intervals in parenthesis.bSE B4.940.139β	  pStep 1p <.001(4.67, 5.22)0.82(.47, 1.17)ConstantCommunityMembership(FSC or other)SE BβpStep 1ConstantCommunityMembership(FSC or other)Step 2b3.530.180.420.55p <.0010.180.36Constantp <.001CommunityMembership(FSC or other)-0.240.18p = .180.19(-.61, .117)0.29Community0.150.22 p= .057Participation(-.01, .59)0.32Community0.180.24 p= .069Organization(-.026, .67)22Note.

There was not a significant relationship between perceived community support or any ofits separate sub-scales with gaming identification or self-concept for individuals in the female supportivecommunity. However, membership in the female supportive community positively predicts higher gamingidentification and self-concept than does perceived community support. In other words, while members of thefemale supportive community may not perceive it as supportive, membership in the community contributes overand above general support. One interpretation for these results is that the community provides structures otherthan perceived support that help with fostering resiliency and increasing identification and efficacy. Onepossibility is the presence of role-models that defy stereotypes of female inability in gaming spaces (since thecommunity contains multiple highly ranked and professional female gamers); another possibility is that itstactics for providing a structured way to deal with harassment online while playing with the community, whichinvolves reporting and muting negative players, while maintaining sportsmanship (Author, 2014), could bescaffolding and modeling a healthier way to deal with threat. As a result, players could have positive structuresto help build investment, confidence, identity and ability.Conclusion, limitations and future directionsThe emergence of learning through affinity spaces holds much promise. The voluntary nature and authenticityof such spaces has led many to observe profound learning taking place that would be challenging to provide informal learning contexts, and the degree of personal identification and identity development with affinity spaceslike gaming cultures may lead to this learning being more impactful for the participants than learning which wasdriven by others’ interests. However, the dark side of affinity spaces is that they may be marginalizing to certaingroups. While prior research has focused on the way that designed elements of such spaces may marginalize orCSCL 2015 Proceedings456© ISLSfail to attract women and girls (and may also have tried to identify ways to design segregated spaces for womenand girls), these approaches treat marginalization as a byproduct of the differences in the marginalized groups.In short, they treat inequity as a woman’s problem, rather than a culture problem. Still, cultures can be changed,in part through leadership and the presence of diverse role models. Minority role models have to come fromsomewhere; often the most resilient among marginalized groups are the ones who can succeed. This workdemonstrates that one important technique for changing cultures that perpetuate inequity is to create learningsub-communities that help protect the marginalized and train for resilience. While this paper has focused on therole this distinct female-supportive community has played in supporting the resilience of female players, wealso have anecdotal evidence that the same community provides support for other marginalized groups,including ethnic, racial, and sexual minorities (see, Richard, 2013a). This suggests that resilience-orientedcommunities can be protective of many groups, and that such protective communities may in fact be able tocontribute to culture change more generally towards tolerance and/or achievement in the face of adversity.In CSCL and the learning sciences, the need for facilitation and the importance of cultural assumptionsin equitable participation in collaborative learning have been well documented for many years (for example, Hsi& Hoadley, 1997; Hoadley, 2002; Lee & Hoadley, 2006). However, responses to these needs has been primarilyto focus on improving the designed environment and/or overlaying tools. This work shows that treatingresilience as an important learning outcome, and the intentional creation of protective communities, is anotherviable technique. While this study only looked at female-supportive communities, it offers implications foridentity-supportive communities across sociocultural experiences. Richard (2013a) has found that ethnic/racialminorities, in particular, are similarly vulnerable to stereotype threat in gaming. A future direction of this workwould be to explore its efficacy for members of other marginalized groups, such as ethnic/racial and sexualminorities. Moreover, further research is needed on how such communities accomplish their protective role,how this role may or may not extend beyond the practice fields in which the communities function, and how todissect what aspects of equity, or inequity, may be attributed to designed environments vs. the cultures thatspring up in those environments.ReferencesAnderson, N., Lankshear, C., Timms, C., & Courtney, L.
