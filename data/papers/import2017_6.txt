Behavioral and Relationship Patterns in an Online CollaborativeReading ActivityHai-Peng Wan, Faculty of Education, Beijing Normal University, haipengwan@gmail.comQi Wang, Faculty of Education, Beijing Normal University, wangqi.20080906@163.comSheng-Quan Yu, Advanced Innovation Center for Future Education, Beijing Normal University,yusq@bnu.edu.cnAbstract: Online collaborative reading has been widely implemented as an instructionalactivity in various context, with many studies demonstrating effective learning outcomes. Basedon knowledge construction theory, we put forward an online collaborative reading approach tolearning from an academic handbook in a graduate-level course. Through examination of thebehavioral patterns and relationship patterns of different phases in the course, we found thatstudent contributions to peers’ micro-courses were not symmetric; some students would submitirrelevant comments in different collaborative phases, and almost all students kept in touch witheach other directly. Our study also indicated that students’ task load and consistency were twoimportant factors to affect their collaborative performance. Our findings would help courseteachers design and conduct collaborative reading activities at the postsecondary level in future.IntroductionKnowledge construction has been widely used and discussed, which emphasizes that students construct newknowledge through social interactions (Huang, 2002; Kanuka & Anderson, 2007). Advancement in internettechnology has led to an increase in instructional activities with computer support, such as English languagereading instruction (Chen, Chen, & Sun, 2010). Based on knowledge construction theory, previous studies ofonline collaborative reading mainly focus on students’ reading attitude, reading comprehension, reading strategy,motivation, and learning effectiveness, and reveal that students in collaborative learning environmentsdemonstrate stronger cognitive development, more positive learning attitude, and higher learning motivation thancontrol groups (Chen & Chen, 2014; Ding, 2009; Lin, Chen, Yang, Xie, & Lin, 2014).1.self-directed reading••••2.designing micro-courseReading academic handbookTaking notesExtending reading related literatureRecording micro-video••••3.peer coaching4.data acquisition and assessment•••Micro-course contentLearning activityLearning assessmentLearning certificationLearning interaction dataLearning engagement dataPresentation in class••••Watching online micro-videoCo-editing micro-course contentAccomplishing learning activityCommenting and remarkingFigure 1. The online collaborative reading procedure. Adopted from Wan et al. (2015)Peer tutoring is vital to collaborative learning (Robinson & Hullinger, 2008). However, students inconventional collaborative learning environments tend to share and compare the available information rather thanto construct new knowledge (Ma, 2009; Schellens, Van Keer, De Wever, & Valcke, 2008). They are usually onlyrequired to finish tasks according to reading materials rather than generate new knowledge for peer to study (Chen& Chen, 2014; Lin et. al, 2014). In this study, we put forward an innovative collaborative reading approach withfour stages: self-directed reading, designing micro-course, peer coaching, and data acquisition and assessment (asshown in Figure 1; for detail referring to Wan, Yu, Cui & Chiang, 2015). Apart from sharing information, studentsnot only need to generate new information through their own reading, but they also need to finish learning theCSCL 2017 Proceedings17© ISLSinformation generated by their peers in this innovative collaborative reading activity. Identification of students’collaboration pattern is of value to pedagogical and technical design (Lin et. al, 2014). For example, the sequentialanalysis technique could demonstrate the sequences of students’ action and has been widely used to analyze onlinecollaborative discussion (Hou & Wu, 2011; Shukor, Tasir, Van der Meijden, & Harun, 2014). Therefore, thisstudy attempted to investigate the students’ behavior and relationship patterns by lag sequential analysis and socialnetwork analysis to provide reference for course teachers to design and conduct collaborative reading activitiesin higher education.MethodParticipantsThe participants were twelve graduate students and one visiting scholar in a graduate course, New Developmentof Educational Technology, at a university in China. The course contained lectures implemented by professorsand the reading activity of an English academic handbook which made up the students’ course assignment. Apartfrom simply reading the English academic handbook, the course required students to make a micro-course of eacharticle they read according to their own understanding. Students were also required to learn and contribute topeers’ micro-courses with the Learning Cell System (an online collaborative learning system described below).All the students received prior training and were capable of using this learning system with ease.ProceduresAt the beginning, the course teacher selected the Handbook of Research on Educational Communications andTechnology (4th edition) published by Springer as reading materials. This handbook was written in English andincluded nine sections with seventy-four articles, covering foundations, methods, assessment and evaluation,general instructional strategies, domain-specific strategies and models, design, planning, and implementation,emerging technologies, technology integration, and look forward. The goal of reading the handbook was tosupport the students in developing a systematic understanding of educational technology research and itsdevelopment.Afterwards, each student randomly chose five or six articles. The course teacher divided the wholesemester into three phases and each phase lasted six weeks. During each phase, the students completed four tasks,(i.e., reading two articles, making two micro-courses, learning twenty-four micro-courses of peers with learningsystem, and making one presentation in an offline class). Those micro-courses required students to create acomplete teaching structure, including a micro digital resource (e.g., micro-video), a learning activity and alearning assessment.Finally, all of the interaction data generated in the process of the collaborative reading activity wereexported to one Excel file for further lag sequential analysis and social network analysis.InstrumentsLearning Cell SystemAn online collaborative learning system entitled Learning Cell System (LCS, http://lcell.bnu.edu.cn) (Yu, Yang,Cheng, & Wang, 2015) was used to observe the behavioral and social network patterns by supporting the wholeprocess of the collaborative reading activity. The heart of LCS is an open, networked, communal knowledgecommunity. Its main functions are learning cell, knowledge group, knowledge cloud, learning tool, personal space,and learning community. A learning cell serves as a micro-course, which usually includes learning content,learning activity and learning assessment. Students could share their ideas and information, and contribute topeers’ ideas through authoring or coauthoring a learning cell.Coding schemeTo understand the learners’ process of social knowledge construction, the items in Gunawardena, Lowe andAnderson’s (1997) coding scheme were adopted as the scheme has been widely used in many studies of onlinecollaborative learning patterns (Choo, Kaur, Fook, & Yong, 2014; Hou & Wu, 2011; Yang, Li, Guo, & Li, 2015).Gunawardena et. al (1997) divided the knowledge construction process into five dimensions: 1) sharing andcomparing information, 2) discovery and exploration of dissonance or inconsistency, 3) negotiation of meaningand co-construction of knowledge, 4) testing and modification of the proposed synthesis and co-construction, and5) agreement statement(s) and applications of newly constructed meanings (see B1 to B5 in Table 1). In addition,we added a new dimension B6 to express irrelevant information to this collaborative reading task. Thus, the codingscheme for content analysis in online collaborative reading behaviors of English academic handbook is shown inCSCL 2017 Proceedings18© ISLSTable 1, which also provides behavior type and content example for each item to more clearly to clarify differentbehaviors.Each log or comment message was treated as a unit and coded, and the codes were then arranged inchronological order. 9343 log messages and 851 comment messages were yielded during the 120-day observation.These log messages were coded according to their categories (e.g., creating learning cell, browsing, cooperativeediting learning cell, remark, reflection) defined in LCS. These comment messages were coded by two coderswith the same expertise according to the scheme and the kappa value was 0.73.Table 1: Coding scheme for knowledge collaborative construction behaviorsCodeB1B2DimensionSharing/comparing ofinformationDiscovery and exploration ofdissonance or inconsistencyamong participantsB3Negotiation of meaning/coconstruction of knowledgeB4Testing and modification ofproposed synthesis or coconstructionB5Agreementstatement(s)/application ofnewly constructed meaningB6Other interactions with norelations with the reading taskBehavior types and examplesCreating learning cell, adding learning activities, uploadinglearning material, and releasing reading work and concept map.Browsing, collecting, and giving feedback on learning cell createdby peer; coming up with confusion during learning.Can “qualitative research” be translated into “质性研究” or “定性研究”?Cooperative editing learning cell, modifying video and content,adjusting content structure, comment.Discussion with peer on topics and give suggestion on problems.Remark, comment, annotation, pointing out problem.I cannot hear clearly of the back of video.

Four micro-courses weresubmitted after the end of course and one micro-course was incomplete. Hence, the coded 10194 messages wereabout those sixty-nine micro-courses. The sum frequency of B1 was 312, of B2 was 7490, of B3 was 963, of B4was 729, of B5 was 401 and of B6 was 299. The distribution of those coded messages in each phase is shown inFigure 2. As shown in Figure 2, the behavior frequency in phase 3 is more than phase 1 and phase 2. And thebehavior frequency difference was very big because students only made 18 micro-courses during the first phase,12 micro-courses during the second phase and 41 micro-courses during the last phase. In each phase, the behaviorfrequency of B2 was always larger than other behaviors, even the sum of other behaviors.GSEQ 5.1 (Bakeman & Quera, 2011) was used to conduct lag sequential analysis by analyzing thebehavioral patterns of knowledge construction in collaborative reading process. Table 2 shows the frequency ofeach behavioral category immediately following another behavioral category in different phases (Phase 1, Phase2, and Phase 3). The columns represent the starting behaviors, whereas the rows represent the behaviors thatoccurred after the starting behaviors ﬁnished. The numbers represent the total number of times a column behavioroccurred immediately after a row behavior ended (e.g., in row 2 column 3, the number 216 meant that “B3occurred immediately after B1,” which happened 216 times in Phase 1).CSCL 2017 Proceedings19© ISLS37942331136584302 182101 92195 131 7673Phase 115551Phase 2B1B2B3B4466 416224 156Phase 3B5B6Figure 2.

The Z-score of a sequence greater than 1.96 means thatthe connectivity of this sequence reached statistical signiﬁcance (p < 0.05) (Bakeman & Gottman, 1997).According to those 22 statistically significant sequences with Z-score greater than 1.96 in Table 3, we formed thebehavioral transition diagrams (see Figure 3.) The node represents one of the six behavioral categories, thenumerical value represents the Z-value for the sequence, the arrowheads represent the transitional direction, andthe connecting line thickness represents the level of signiﬁcance.Table 3: Adjusted residuals table (Z-scores) (Phase 1 to Phase 3)Phase 1Z-scoreB1B2B3CSCL 2017 ProceedingsB130.88*−9.730.22B2−9.6013.05*−1.70B31.44−1.612.51*20B4−1.85−0.192.08*B5−1.70−11.75−1.33B6−0.32−9.15−1.79© ISLSB4B5B6B1B2B3B4B5B6B1B2B3B4B5B6Phase 2Phase 3−2.06−1.51−0.7014.43*−5.961.51−1.67−0.970.2535.87*−9.74−1.07−3.19−2.29−0.80−16.961.750.74−5.0810.77*−4.50−12.102.00*1.27−10.4713.25*1.71-24.105.48*4.88*−1.250.030.021.73−3.826.39*−1.04−1.08−0.603.43*3.54*−1.50−2.41−3.37−2.2926.59*−1.32−1.78−0.58−7.52−1.8816.95*−0.62−0.77−2.29−14.06−3.6130.38*−0.90−2.30-0.900.01−0.17−1.920.111.610.33−0.11−1.42−3.44−1.523.52*4.05*−2.00−2.5619.98*−1.790.80−1.46−6.89−1.5315.93*−1.480.54−1.28−12.65−2.2826.44*−2.29−1.29Figure 3 shows that there were remarkably different behavior sequences in different phases. In phase 1,the significant behavioral sequences included: B1→B1, B2→B2, B3→B3, B3→B4, B4→B5, and B4→B6.Meanwhile, phase 2 also had six significant behavioral sequences, just B5→B2 substituting B3→B4. In phase 3,the significant behavioral sequences included: B1→B1, B1→B3, B2→B2, B2→B3, B3→B4, B4→B4, B4→B5,B4→B6, B5→B2 and B6→B2. In addition, B1→B3, B2→B3, B6→B2 were three new emerging behavioralpaths. These sequences demonstrated the whole behavioral patterns in online collaborative reading activity.30.8813.05B12.51B214.43B310.77B12.08B6B526.5919.98Phase 1B46.39B3B2B5B135.872.00B616.953.4313.25B4B24.88B65.48B326.44Phase 2Phase 33.524.05B515.93Figure 3. Behavioral transition diagrams in different phases.3.54B430.38First, let us turn to those uniform behavioral sequences in the three phases. The behavioral path B1→B1in the three phase indicates that students tended to preserve their behavioral transition when they shared orcompared information. This is because students usually added learning activities or uploaded resources aftercreating learning cells. And the Z-score of behavioral path B1→B1 in three phase seems to be positively correlatedto the number of micro-courses created by students in each phase. The behavioral path B2→B2 in the three phasesindicates that students tended to maintain their behavioral transition when they discovered and explored thedissonance or inconsistency. In order to understand peers’ micro-course, students needed to watch the microvideos again and again, and participated in learning activities. The Z-score of behavioral path B4→B5 in eachphase is relatively large, which demonstrates B4 and B5 have significant correlations with each other in thecollaborative reading process. But this result is inconsistent with the previous research findings (Hou, Chang, &Sung, 2007; Hou & Wu, 2011; Yang et. al, 2015), which held the view that B4 and B5 rarely occurred in theoverall cooperation process. During this online collaborative reading activity, however, students were promptedto revise their micro-courses according to peers’ comments before reaching an agreed upon understanding of thecore idea of the article related to the micro-course. The behavioral path B4→B6 in each phase reveals that studentsdiscussed some irrelevant topics with the current collaborative reading task after pointing out the problem orrating. In addition, the Z-score of this behavioral path is very high in each phase, which indicates that the teacherneeded to give some guides to help students solve the problem rather than just let the students explore freely.Next, we explain the disparate behavioral sequences in each phase as shown in Figure 2. In phase 1,students always maintained their behavioral transition when they collaboratively edited the learning cell, adjustedcontent or learning activity, and discussed with peer about article idea (B3→B3, Z-score=2.53). Meanwhile, thebehavioral path B3→B4(Z-score=2.08) suggests that students would often give a rating after they had completedCSCL 2017 Proceedings21© ISLSmicro-course learning or proposed questions. In phase 2, the behavioral path B3→B3 shows that studentsmaintained their collaborative editing of the learning cell, adjusting content or learning activity and discussingideas in the article with peers. Those behaviors could facilitate the advancement of the micro-course, and that mayexplain why the quality of the micro-course in the first two phases was better than the last phase. In addition,students did not make reflections or state their point of view all the time, rather, they put forward new questionsor expressed confusion during their agreement statements (B5→B2, Z-score=2.00). Being a coauthor of peers’micro-course means that the student would have the same authority as the micro-course creator, such as editinglearning content without checking, and cooperatively designing the learning activity and learning assessment. Inphase 3, students coauthored peers’ micro-courses and added learning activity and uploaded the resources bythemselves (B1→B3, Z-score=3.43). Moreover, students coauthored their peer’s micro-courses and providedsome solutions for problems when they learned in the micro-courses (B2→B3, Z-score=3.54). In addition, ahelpful behavioral path B6→B2 indicates that students did not do irrelevant things repeatedly, but returned tolearn in the micro-courses or declare their confusion. Moreover, students sustained their behavioral path B3→B4appearing in phase1, and B5→B2 appearing in phase 2.Next, Ucinet 6 (Borgatti, Everett, & Freeman, 2002) was used to conduct social network analysis byanalyzing the patterns of relationship among members in collaborative reading process. Figure 4 illustrates thatthe social network of collaborative reading activity is a connected graph. The node represents the student, the linerepresents the relationship between students, and the arrow direction represents the information flow. Cohesionmeans that a network of individuals contains many ties and yields a tighter structure, which is usually identifiedby density, reciprocity, and actor distance (Hu & Racherla, 2008). The density of this network is 0.92, whichimplies that it is high-density network. Students almost kept in touch with every other student. The hybridreciprocity of the network is 0.83, which implies lots of reciprocal interactions generated among students. Theaverage distance of the network is 1.01, which implies that each student could almost directly contact with otherstudents. In short, the whole social relationship network was symmetric, and all the students maintained arelatively frequent contact with each other, except the visiting scholar who only designed her own micro-courseswithout learning from other students’ micro-courses. The reason for it may be she did not hold any pressure toobtain the course credit. Hence, it required course teachers to take the consistency of participants intoconsideration before implementation.Figure 4. Social relationships network in online collaborative reading activity.Conclusions and suggestionsIn this study, we coded the logs and comment message contents, and conducted a sequential analysis of behaviorsand a social network analysis in an online collaborative reading activity. We found that 1) the behavioralsequences of students’ knowledge construction presented different characteristics in three phases, though someCSCL 2017 Proceedings22© ISLSbehavioral paths, such as B1→B1, B2→B2, B4→B5, and B4→B6, appeared all the time; 2) the behavioral pathbecame more and more abundant with further deepened collaboration, such as the path B6→B2 emerging in thethird phase, which might be caused by students’ increasing interest and adeptness in this innovative collaborativereading approach; 3) students maintained relatively frequent contact with each other, which might be due to peercoaching instruction strategy. In addition, we also discovered that 1) contributions that students made to peers’micro-courses were not symmetric, such as someone contributing a lot to peers’ micro-courses but receiving littlecontribution from peers on his or her own micro-courses; 2) students would submit some irrelevant comments inorder to increase their course score. One reason for the irrelevant information may be that LCS could not makesemantic analysis of students’ comment content automatically at this moment which resulted in assessmentaccording to the quantity rather quality. A possible solution to these problems is that the course teacher designs abetter assessment scheme including artificial assessment and word segmentation. Moreover, contributions to peers’micro-courses and the quality of comments should be covered in artificial assessment.In summary, this study explored interactive behavioral patterns and relationship patterns in an onlinecollaborative reading activity through an innovative approach. This innovative approach is very different fromprevious studies: we used adult participants while previous studies used primary and secondary school students(Chen & Chen, 2014; Goh, Chai, & Tsai, 2013; Lin et. al, 2014); each of our participants used different readingmaterial, rather than having participants use the same material (Chen et. al, 2010; Looi, Lin, & Liu, 2008); andwe employed a new learning platform(LCS) for knowledge building, rather than using wiki (Chang, 2009;Kimmerle, Moskaliuk, & Cress, 2011) or knowledge forum (Hong, 2014; Hong, Chang, & Chai, 2014).Furthermore, our findings are helpful to further study collaborative reading among EFL students in highereducation. For course teachers, they need to provide an effective incentive mechanism and assessment scheme,take the students’ load of reading task and participants’ consistency into considerations, and allocate the materialsof the same theme to one person. Nevertheless, there exist some limitations to this study. Firstly, only thirteenstudents participated in this study which led to some analysis outcomes that are not statistically significant. Second,the study lasted a long time and generated many behaviors, with the result that some behaviors wereinappropriately coded according to the categories defined in LCS. In the future, we will increase the number ofparticipants and set up a control group to investigate the actual effect of this innovative collaborative readingapproach on learning performance.ReferencesBakeman, R., & Gottman, J.
