We tested three display technologies,VR HMD, 3D projection and AR HMD, in two math learning scenarios. Different displaytechniques significantly affected user experience in learning. Results on visual comfort, flowexperience, and learning experience in the VR HMD condition are significantly higher thanthose in 3D projection and the AR condition. We conclude that VR HMD contributes to betterviewing experience and learning experience for hands-on VELE in the scenarios tested.Whether the results still hold reliably in more complex learning activities and long-termlearning need to be further studied.IntroductionExperiential learning can be an effective way to promote learning interest. Through interactive and hands-onexperience, learners not only can transfer the experience gained through learning activities into the constructionof knowledge, but also develop positive intrinsic interest and extrinsic behaviors (Huang et al., 2016).Experiential learning requires appropriate tools, locales, and equipment, some of which are difficult to create(e.g. different ecosystems) or experience (e.g. surgical operations). It has been therefore often limited withfixed locations (e.g. mechanical assembly). With the advancement of digital media, real-time virtual reality(VR), and augmented reality (AR) technologies, various types of experiential learning now can be designed innew ways. These new technologies support the creation of vivid, lifelike virtual experiential learningenvironment (VELE), with some already showing superiorities over traditional learning (Furió, Juan, Seguí† &Vivó, 2015; Alhalabi, 2017).In VELE, embodied interaction (EI) design is a way to enable people to interact mentally as well asphysically with information technology and has been considered as a human-computer interaction approach forimproving interaction efficiency and interaction experience (Zhang, Li, & Wachs, 2016). Learners in a VELE issupported with intuitive embodied experience which may reduce their cognitive load and contributes to theinternalization of knowledge (Furió, Juan, Seguí† & Vivó, 2015). Different VR technologies have been appliedin VELEs where display characteristics maybe a key factor influencing user experience, especially for EI design.In this paper, we present a study of three immersive display technologies to test how they each enhancesviewing experience and interaction efficiency in experiential learning.Participants and experimental designA total of 26 volunteers (15 males and 11 females, 23.00±3.34 years) participated in the experiment. Weadopted a single-factor within-subject design. The within-subject factor is 3D display modes which include 3conditions: VR HMD, 3D projection, and AR HMD. Except for the display technology, other factors werecontrolled among the three conditions. There are six dependent variables: visual comfort, flow experience andfour learning experience indicators (intrinsic interest, concentration, behavior intention, and presence). Thepresentation order of different display modes was counterbalanced.Experimental mission and apparatusWe constructed a VELE for math learning and designed two learning scenarios (Figure 1). Users explore thedigital scenes and manipulate virtual objects using HTC vive handheld controllers which are represented in thevirtual environment as a pair of virtual hands. Users may feel like that they are manipulating the virtual objectswith their own hands (Figure 1). The two learning scenarios are used with three display modes (Figure 2).ICLS 2018 Proceedings1371© ISLSScenario 1: Calculation of Cone VolumeScenario 2: Tower of Hanoi problemFigure 1.

Results are shown in Table 1. Different displaytechniques/conditions are indeed an important factor affecting experiences in VELE. As illustrated in Table 1,for the majority of the indicators of visual comfort and learning experience, the values in VR HMD conditionare significantly better than those in 3D projection and AR HMD condition. Within the scenarios tested in thisstudy, VR HMD contributes to better viewing experience and learning experience for hands-on VELE.Table 1: Descriptive statistics and Difference test results in different display condition.3DImageViewing AvoidanceDisplay experience Naturalnes quality experienceofFlowM(S.D)conditions M(S.D)sM(S.D) discomfort M(S.D)M(S.D)M(S.D)4.424.284.3113.588.9263.77VR HMD(0.84)(2.18)(1.32)(8.04)(0.95)(0.93)3D3.883.884.0810.388.1556.12(0.84)(3.20)(1.84)(11.68)Projection(0.95)(0.88)3.733.643.779.7707.6552.12AR HMD(1.04)(0.99)(0.91)(3.15)(2.19)(16.2)F value3.404*2.20412.532**3.638*6.206**2.933IntrinsicinterestM(S.D)12.88(1.92)11.23(2.97)11.19(3.32)3.018+Behavior ConcentratintentionionPresenceM(S.D)M(S.D)M(S.D)12.50(1.96)10.69(2.91)10.38(3.59)4.406*9.08 (1.96)9.19 (1.67)8.69 (1.59)0.58512.58(1.90)10.42(3.32)10.81(3.15)4.211*ReferencesAlhalabi, W.
