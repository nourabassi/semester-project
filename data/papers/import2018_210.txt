Achievement Goals and Team Leadership in Online Small GroupLearningLin Lu, The Ohio State University, lu.962@osu.eduKui Xie, The Ohio State University, xie.359@osu.eduAbstract: Group learning is a common used learning approach in online education. However,there are limited studies addressing how to support online groups from the perspectives ofmotivation and team leadership. This study attempts to understand how achievement goalsand leadership styles could influence collaboration experience and individual performance.The results showed that learners who adopted mastery goals tended to engage in grouplearning through promoting member relationships and group cohesion whereas leaders whoadopted performance goals tended to concentrate on helping group complete tasks. High levelof relationship-orientated leadership made performance-approach goal orientation asignificant predictor of collaboration experience and reduced the negative effect ofperformance-avoidance goals on final grade. This study finally provides insights to onlinegroup activity design.IntroductionSmall group learning is a commonly used instructional approach in online education. There are a few challengesthat have been discerned such as the reduction of social and contextual cues, trust issue among team members,feeling of isolation, and technical uncertainty (DeRosa, Hantula, Kock, & D’Arcy, 2004). From a teamleadership perspective, research has found that virtual team leadership is necessary for quality teamperformance, however at the same time how leaders or leadership functions in virtual teams is still underexploration (Avolio, Walumbwa, & Weber, 2009; Hertel, Geister, & Konradt, 2005). What makes thechallenges even more critical is that leadership in online classrooms are sometimes not explicitly specified bythe instructor. In this scenario, leadership roles are little structured and group process is weakly scaffold by theinstructor. Informal leadership will gradually emerge in effective online groups, whereas some other groupsmight stay leaderless towards the end of the group life. The goal of the current study is to understand howemergent leadership in formal online educational settings affect group healthiness as well as individualacademic achievement.Motivation in individual and group learningIn academic settings, students’ achievement motivation is strongly associated with how they engage in learningactivities and further academic performance. Goal orientations refer to the reason why students study. Theclassic model differentiates three goal orientations: mastery, performance-approach (PAP), and performanceavoidance (PAV) goal orientation (Middleton & Midgley, 1997). Mastery goals represent students’ main focuson understanding subject content and developing competence, whereas performance goals reflect the focus ondemonstrating competence and how ability will be judged relative to others. The main difference between PAPand PAV goals is striving to outperform others versus striving to avoid doing poorly than others. Research hasfound a volume of benefits of adopting mastery goals for its positive influence on learning interest, persistence,psychological well-being, and so forth (e.g., Linnenbrink-Garcia & Pintrich, 2000). Particularly, studentsadopting mastery goals are more likely prefer group collaboration than those who adopt performance goals(Elliot et al., 2016). On the other hand, PAP goals are associated with lower performance, superficial learningstrategy use, and fear of failure. Online education has shown its advantages in reducing social comparisonamong learners which is promising in terms of encouraging mastery goal adoption.Leadership as engagement in group learningIn earlier literature studying leadership in face-to-face teams, there is a classic dichotomous model viewingleadership as functional acts: task-oriented and relationship-oriented leadership (e.g., Stogdill, 1969). In nonacademic settings, a typical task-oriented leader (T-leadership) focuses on completing tasks and tends to bemore directive, autocratic, and critical, whereas relationship-oriented leader (R-leadership) tends to beconsiderate, permissive, democratic, and person-oriented. Research has shown the contingency effect of the twoleadership style on team effectiveness. Generally, T-leadership style would be more effective in extreme teamsituations (e.g., members are not very close or very close to each other), whereas R-leadership styles are moreeffective than T-leadership when member relationship is intermediate (Strube & Garcia, 1981). This model hasICLS 2018 Proceedings965© ISLSalso been applied in a computer-mediated communication environment (e.g., Yamaguchi, Bos, & Olson, 2002;Xie, Sun, & Lu, 2015; Xie, Hensley, Law, & Sun, 2017). Particularly, in online groups without formal leaders,multiple group members can act like both task- and relationship- oriented leaders. At the same time, groupmembers may not actively engaged in leadership roles. Therefore, under the perspective of leadership as sharedleadership roles among group members, this study attempts to understand how leadership as an activeinvestigation in group learning could affect collaboration experience and individual learning outcomes.Research QuestionsSynthesizing theories and empirical findings, this study attempts to study the following research questions:1. Can goal orientations predict leadership styles, group cohesion, and individual learning outcome?2. Does leadership moderate the effect of goal orientations on group cohesion and individual learningoutcome?MethodologyContext and participantsThe study was conducted in an undergraduate-level online course at a large public university in the MidwestUnited States during spring and summer 2013. The seven-week-long course covered the topics of learningstrategies such as note taking, reading, studying, presentation skills, and resilience in order to help studentsimprove college course achievement. There are in total 171 students from 32 groups and six sessions of thecourse participated. Most of them were professional and continuing education students. Through groupdiscussion, students shared ideas and received feedback from groupmates for creating individual learningportfolios. Online discussion posts and portfolios were both graded based on the quality and the quantity.Measures and data collectionAchievement goals were measured by the achievement goals questionnaire (Elliot & Church, 1997). Leadershipstyles were measured by two scales of which each measuring a specific form of leadership, adapted fromStogdill’s (1969) Leadership Behavior Descriptor Questionnaire. R-leadership scale measured the degree towhich students perceived themselves as facilitating positive interactions among group members, whereas Tleadership scale measured the degree to which students perceived themselves as helping the group attain goals.The group cohesion scale (Chin, et al., 1999) measured a sense of belonging to and having connectednessthroughout the group. All items focused on the specific context of the course and were measured on a sevenpoint scale. Achievement goals were measured at the beginning of each class, whereas other variables werecollected at the end. All scales exhibited acceptable levels of internal consistency (Hair, Black, Babin,Anderson, & Tatham, 2006). See Table 1 for details of variables.Table 1.

Two multiple linear regression models (Model 1.1 and 1.2in Table 2) were built with the two leadership styles as the dependent variable of each. Results showed that PAPgoals played the strongest predictor role of T-leadership (t= 4.86, df= 111, p<.001); mastery goal orientationsignificantly predicted R-leadership (t=3.52, df=111, p=.001). PAV goal orientation negatively predicted bothleadership styles with weaker effect size on R-leadership (Coef. = -.18, t= -1.87, df = 110, p = .06, 95% CI = [.36, .01]) compared to T-leadership (Coef. = -.21, t = -2.16, df = 111, p = .03, 95% CI= [-.40, -.02]). The resultswere consistent with the previous research results on the matching effect of goal orientations and leadershipstyles (Xie & Huang, 2014).Second, can goal orientations predict individual collaboration experience? We use individual perceivedgroup cohesion as the measure of collaboration experience. Multiple linear regression analysis (Model 2.1)suggested that only mastery goal positively predicted perceived group cohesion (t=5.13, df=167.p<.001).Does leadership play moderation role in the effect of goal orientations on collaboration experience?Multiple linear regression analysis (Model 2.2) showed that PAP goals failed to significantly predictcollaboration experience, however, its interaction term with R-leadership level was a significant predictor,controlling the effect of mastery goal (t=5.33, df=167.p<.001). In other words, only higher level of R-leadershipwould make PAP goal a significant predictor of collaboration experience.Regarding individual performance which was measured by final grade of the course, Model 3.1suggested that mastery goals positively and PAV goals negatively predicted final grade. Both PAP goals andgroup cohesion has no significant impact on individual performance. Beyond these general relationship betweengoal orientations and learning performance, does leadership plays moderation role in the effect of goalorientations on grade? Among the three goal orientations, mastery goals and PAV goals were the two significantpredictors of the final grade. Model 3.2 showed that T-leadership level significantly reduced the negative effectof PAV goals on final grade (t=2.96, df=167.p=.003), although the main effect of PAV goals was still negative,controlling the effect of mastery goal. In other words, only higher level of R-leadership would make PAP goalorientation a significant predictor of collaboration experience.In sum, we found consistent findings of the close relationship between mastery goals, R-leadershipstyle, and group cohesion as well the tight relationship between PAP goals, T-leadership style, and final grade.R-leadership helped strong PAP goal to affect collaboration experience, whereas T-leadership played slightlyreduced the negative effect of PAV goal on learning performance. However, in this course, collaborationexperience was found to neither hinder nor facilitate individual performance. This gives a heads-up forinstructional design, advocating for integrating group learning to the path to individual growth rather than astand-alone class activities.Table 2.

There was 43% of variance in group cohesionexplained. The correlation between group-level T-leadership and R-leadership was too strong to avoid multicollinearity problem. The final model therefore only contained R-leadership and other predictors according totheoretically closer relationship between R-leadership and group cohesion. Not surprisingly, the average level ofgroup cohesion was best predicted by group-level R-leadership (t= 3.25, p= .003, 95% CI= [.1825815,.8175336]). Interestingly, heterogeneity of PAV goals negatively predicts group cohesion (t=-2.02, p=.054, 95%CI=[-3.408462, .0327989]). In other words, members sensed the group belongingness more strongly when theyhad similar level (high, medium, or low) of PAV goals. There was no other patterns found about goalorientations and average group cohesion. On the other hand, none of the group-level variables significantlypredicted either group level T- or R- leadership.Significance and limitationsBy examining leadership in small online group, the role of group learning experience on learning outcomes wastested. Regarding the limitations, group-level analysis was conducted with small sample from specific context,which restricts the generalizability. Future investigation would use multivariate linear models consideringgroup-level and individual-level variables at the same time.ReferencesAvolio, B. J., Walumbwa, F. O., & Weber, T. J. (2009).
