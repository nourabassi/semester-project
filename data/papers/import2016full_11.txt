Practitioners and researchers have wellrecognized the critical role of the pre-class learning on students’ performance in the flippedclass. However, little research has investigated how students learn in the pre-class setting andwhat factors can help students improve their pre-class learning. Based upon the self-regulatedlearning theory, this study used both survey research and learning analytics methods to uncoverstudents’ performance trajectories of a semester in two flipped undergraduate math courses andexamined whether the three key self-regulated learning factors – self-efficacy, the use ofmetacognitive strategy, and self-regulatory behaviors – were significantly different acrossdifferent performance trajectories. The results revealed six different performance trajectoriesamong students and found significant differences across these trajectories in terms of the threeself-regulatory factors.Keywords: self-regulated learning, flipped classroom, learning analytics, survey-based researchIntroductionThe flipped classroom model has attracted ever-growth attention since its inception in 2007. It is an emerginginstructional model that commonly consists of two parts: pre-class Internet-based individual learning and in-classgroup-based collaborative learning (Bishop & Verleger, 2013). In a flipped class, students normally learn contentmaterials through online instructional videos and text readings on their own pace and schedule prior to the class.Then they gather together in person and apply learned knowledge through group-based collaborative activities ina classroom (Bergmann& Sams, 2012; Herreid & Schiller, 2013). The in-class activities are oftentimes designedto be highly associated with the pre-class learning materials. Thus, the success of in-class learning is heavily reliedon students’ preparation in pre-class. In the practice of flipped classroom model, teachers have observed thecritical influence of the pre-class preparation on the in-class performance (Schell, 2013). Research also empiricallydemonstrated the significantly positive relationship between the pre-class and in-class achievement (Sun, 2015).Given the important role of the pre-class learning in the flipped classroom, how do students learn in the pre-classand what factors can help students improve their pre-class learning have been continuous questions among flippedclassroom teachers.The pre-class online learning emphasizes a student-centered learning environment, in which studentstake control of their own learning process (Flipped Learning Network, 2014). For example, students are providedwith various learning resources, and they navigate through the materials and learn the content at flexible time,pace, and space (Fulton, 2012). To ensure that they are prepared for the in-class group activities, students areoftentimes required to watch the associated lecture videos and complete the assigned homework prior to class.However, this student-centered way of learning has been a well-known challenge for both students and teachers.Students complain the workload ahead, and teachers lack awareness and confidence that students would spendenough time and efforts on the lectures and be prepared for the in-class activities (Acedo, 2013). To overcomethis challenge, researchers suggest that a new or advanced student-centered skill set is demanded to support suchthe student-centered way of learning (Estes, Ingram, & Liu, 2014). That means, students are expected to beproactive, inquire, and obtain foundational knowledge in a self-directed manner to succeed in the pre-classlearning (Talbert, 2014). They are also desired to be active in the setting and pursuit of learning goals, use certainlearning strategies to solve problems, monitor their behaviors, and reflect on the performance. In essence, thestudent-centered environment promotes self-regulated learning as a critical and helpful skill set for theenhancement of students’ pre-class learning performance (Connor, Newman, & Deyoe, 2013).Self-regulated learning is an integrated learning process that regulates students’ motivation, behaviors,and metacognitive activities to pursue the planned and adapted personal goals (Schunk, 2001). The self-regulatedlearning research has suggested three factors that are significant in the self-regulation process, which are selfefficacy (Bandura, 1997; Pintrich & Zusho, 2007), the use of metacognitive strategy (Duncan & McKeachie, 2005;Winne, 2001), and the regulation of behaviors (Hadwin et al., 2007; Winne & Hadwin, 2008). Self-efficacyICLS 2016 Proceedings66© ISLSdenotes as “people’s judgments of their capabilities to organize and execute courses of action required to attaindesignated types of performances” (Bandura, 1986, p.391). Research has demonstrated its robust predicting effecton academic performance (Crede & Philips, 2011) and also suggested its fundamental role in the self-regulatedlearning process (Winne & Hadwin, 1998, 2008). According to the self-regulated learning model proposed byWinne and Hadwin (1998), while giving a learning task, students normally first define the task such as an easy ora hard task based on their own cognitive factors, and such the definition of the task will guide their following selfregulatory behaviors, for example the regulation of learning time and efforts. Self-efficacy, as one of the cognitivefactors, helps students to first generate the task definition and then leads them to regulate their behaviors tocomplete the task. For example, if a student holds higher-level self-efficacy towards a task, he or she would feelmore confident to perform the task, devote more time and efforts in the task, and persist longer while meetingobstacles during the task.Metacognitive strategy refers to the self-evaluation strategy that guides students’ planning, monitoring,and modifying their cognition and behavior (Pintrich & De Groot, 1990). The use of this strategy is believed tobe the hallmark of self-regulating one’s learning process because by using this strategy, students compare theircurrent profiles of task performance with the standards they set previously for satisfactory task performances,create a list of matches and mismatches between the current profiles and the standards, and regulate theirmotivation, cognition, and behavior in the following learning activities (Winne, 2001). Research has revealed thatthe use of metacognitive strategy plays an important role in students’ learning and, in general, is positively relatedwith academic performance (Pintrich, 2004). In particular, the use of metacognitive strategy has been quite criticalin the hypermedia or computer-supported learning environment (Azevedo, 2005). Because such the learningenvironment provides students with dynamic and nonlinear access to a wide range of information represented astexts, graphs, and videos, without deploying the metacognitive strategy, students are unable to monitor theirperformances and easily lost in the great amount of information (Azevedo & Cromely, 2004). The pre-classlearning setting is the environment that supports students’ learning mainly by computers, which shares the samefeature in the students’ self-directed learning with the hypermedia learning environment. Therefore, the use ofmetacognitive strategy is believed to be a significant part of the self-regulated learning in the pre-class setting.The regulation of behaviors in general means the management one’s behaviors in ways to achieve setgoals (Carlson & Moses, 2001). Pintrich and his colleagues (1993) attempted to summarize the essential selfregulatory learning behaviors into four categories in the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire, whichare time/study environmental management, effort regulation, peer learning, and help seeking. They believed thatto achieve certain learning goals, self-regulated learners tend to find a specific time and place that they canconcentrate on the learning task, spend more time on doing the task and persist longer while meeting obstacles,identify peers in the class who are capable of answering questions, and feel unafraid to seek help from others ifneeded. Both research and theory suggest that self-regulatory behaviors students enacted during learning have apositive effect on their achievement (Winne & Hadwin, 2008).The majority of research explored the effects of these three self-regulatory factors on students’ one-timeachievement such as a post-test score or a final exam score (Azevedo & Cromely, 2004; Crede & Philips, 2011).Since the self-regulated learning is a process, it is valuable to explore the effects of such the self-regulatory processon a performance trajectory or trend, for example a performance trend in an entire semester. Because comparedto the one-time achievement, the analysis of the performance trend is able to provide more detailed look onstudents’ learning process during a semester and identify potential linkage between changes in the performanceand the self-regulatory factors.In this paper, we first identify students’ performance trajectories based on four major exam scoresobtained during a semester in two flipped undergraduate math courses, and then investigate whether there aresignificant mean differences across different performance trajectory groups in terms of the three key self-regulatedlearning factors – math self-efficacy, the use of metacognitive strategy, and self-regulatory behaviors. We useboth survey research and learning analytics methods to uncover students’ self-regulated learning process in thepre-class learning setting. These methods allow us to examine both students’ psychological perceptions and theirdetailed learning behaviors during the pre-class learning. Two major research questions guide the design of thisstudy, which are as follows:1. What are students’ performance trajectories in a semester in the flipped undergraduate math courses?2. Are there any mean differences across different performance trajectories in terms of math self-efficacy,the use of metacognitive strategy, and self-regulatory behaviors?ICLS 2016 Proceedings67© ISLSMethodsParticipantsA total of 151 undergraduate students from Calculus I and II courses in a large Midwestern university in theUnited States participated in the study. There were 50.3% female and 49% male. The majority of participantswere White students (68.9%), followed by Asian students (25.2%), and the rest from other ethnical backgrounds.Over 84% of students were freshmen and sophomore.Study context and procedureThe study included 16 flipped sessions of Calculus I and II. Every Tuesday and Thursday, students attended 55minutes recitation sessions either in person or through online web-conferencing tool. During the recitation session,students applied newly learned knowledge from the pre-class learning through problem-based and group-basedwork. To effectively learn in the recitation session, students were required to complete the associated pre-classlectures before attending the recitation session. An online lecture commonly consisted of lecture videos,information slides, embedded quizzes, formative feedback for the quizzes, and associated homework at the endof the online lecture. To obtain the insight of students’ perceptions of their self-regulated learning, two onlinesurveys were sent to consented students at the 3rd and 10th week of the semester.MeasuresMeasures of this study include math self-efficacy, the use of metacognitive strategy, behavioral data, and examscores. Math self-efficacy and the use of metacognitive strategy were measured on seven-point Likert scales atthe first and second survey, respectively. The behavioral log data was retrieved at the end of the semester fromthe learning management system that students used for the flipped courses. The four major exam scores wereobtained from the course instructors. Means, standard deviations, Cronbach’s alpha of survey scales, andcorrelation coefficients between all variables are summarized in Table 1.Math Self-efficacy (MSE): Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ: Pintrich et al.,1991) is a widely used measure in the areas of motivation and self-regulated learning (Anthony & Artino, 2005).Extensive research has provided evidences to show that MSLQ is a reliable and valid instrument (Pintrich et al.,1993; Duncan & McKeachie, 2005). The 5-item self-efficacy subscale of MSLQ was adapted to measure students’math self-efficacy of learning in the flipped math courses. One sample item is “I’m confident I can understandthe basic concepts taught in math.”Use of Metacognitive Strategy: The 12-item metacognitive self-regulation learning strategy subscale ofMSLQ was adapted to measure students’ use of metacognitive strategy while learning in the pre-class onlinesetting of the flipped courses. One sample item is “When studying the pre-class lecture materials, I try to determinewhich concepts I don’t understand well.”Behavioral Data: Three types of behavioral data were retrieved from the learning management system,which include the number of attempts for each online homework, the progress of watching each online lecture(i.e. complete the lecture or not complete), and the time (minutes) spent on each online lecture. These behavioraldata were log data that presents detailed information of how students work on each online lecture and homeworkduring the semester.Exam Scores: Students were tested four times during the semester in the paper-and-pencil exams. Thefour exams largely evenly spread out in the semester, and each exam was designed to test students’ understandingand application of the learned knowledge prior to the exam. There were 16 weeks in the entire semester. Exam 1was conducted in week 4; exam 2 was in week 9; exam 3 was in week 14; and exam 4 was in week 16. The firstthree exams were the midterms, and they, in total, accounted for 50% of the final grade. The last exam was thefinal exam, and it accounted for one third (approximately 33%) of the final grade.Table 1: Means, standard deviations, Cronbach’s alpha, and correlation coefficients of measuresVariableMeanSD1.

Hierarchical clustering, compared to other clustering methods, better helps researchers to explore theunknown numbers of latent groups in the dataset based on the similarity of interested variables (Vellido, Castro,& Nebot, 2011). In this study, students took four major exams at the 3rd, 9th, 14th, and 16th week of the semesterthat assessed their understanding of the content knowledge within a certain period of time. The scores of the fourexams were standardized before the analysis. Ward’s minimum variance method (Ward, 1963) was used as thecriterion to evaluate the similarity by the squared Euclidean distances between groups. Each cluster or group wasexpected to describe a different performance trajectory of students in the semester.ANOVA analysisANOVA analysis was the primary method that used to answer the second research question. The dependentvariables included the three self-regulatory factors – math self-efficacy, the use of metacognitive strategy, andself-regulatory behaviors. The independent variable was the performance trajectory groups generated by clusteranalysis. In addition, Tukey’s HSD test, a post hoc tests in ANOVA, was conducted to further explore the meandifferences of the three self-regulatory factors across different performance trajectory groups at an adjusted alphalevel .017 (i.e. .05/3).FindingsCluster analysis findingsAgglomeration schedule was examined to determine the number of clusters that could be kept for further analysis.Figure 1 demonstrated the grouping procedure with the distances between clusters in each combining stage. It wasnoticed that the increase of distance between clusters started to go up from the stage of cluster 7 to the stage ofcluster 4. To see which stage caused the highest increase of distance after combining clusters, Figure 2 was plotted.It was shown that the change of distance between clusters increased dramatically after agglomerating cases fromsix clusters to five clusters. This indicated that six clusters could be an appropriate solution.Figure 1. Distance between clusters.Figure 2. Distance change between clusters.Figure 3 below demonstrates a six-group solution. Based on the performance trend, we interpret thesesix groups as follows:1. Group 1 – High performance group: Students in group 1 started above the standard mean of the examand ended also above the standard mean of the exam. There was a slightly increasing trend of theperformance during the semester.2. Group 2 – Decreasing performance group: Students in group 2 started at a high level, around onestandard deviation above the standard mean of the exam, but ended around the standard mean of theexam. There was a clearly decreasing trend of the performance during the semester.3. Group 3 – Increasing performance group: Students in group 3 started below the standard mean of theexam but ended above the standard mean of the exam. There was a clearly increasing trend of theperformance during the semester.ICLS 2016 Proceedings69© ISLS4.5.6.Group 4 – Decreasing performance group: Students in group 4 started above the standard mean of theexam but ended below the standard mean of the exam. There was a clearly decreasing trend of theperformance during the semester.Group 5 – Increasing performance group: Although students in group 5 started below the standard meanof the exam and also ended below the standard mean, there was a slightly increasing trend of theperformance during the semester.Group 6 – Low performance group: Students in group 6 started below the standard mean of the examand decreased to even lower grade at the end of the semester.Figure 3. Students’ performance trajectories in a semester.ANOVA analysis findingsANOVA analysis results showed that there were significant mean differences among the six performancetrajectory groups in terms of math self-efficacy [F(5,145)=10.493, p<.001], the use of metacognitive strategy[F(5,108)=3.959, p=.002], the number of attempts for each online homework [F(5,9666)=7.248, p<.001], and theprogress of watching each online lecture [F(5,9676)=13.463, p<.001]. No significant difference was found on thetime spent on each online lecture across the six groups. The detailed descriptive statistics of each group includingnumber of cases, mean, and standard deviation of each self-regulatory factor were summarized in Table 2.In addition, Tukey’s HSD post hoc test revealed more detailed information regarding the meandifferences across six groups by pairwise comparison. Specifically, with respect to math self-efficacy, perceivedmath self-efficacy in group 1 was significantly higher than the rest groups and followed by the order: group 2,group 3 or 4, group 5, and group 6. No significant difference was detected between group 3 and 4. This resultindicates that students in group 1 hold the highest level of confidence in their capabilities of learning math, whilestudents in group 6 have the lowest level of confidence, and students in group 2 are more confident than those ingroup 3 and 4. Based on Figure 3, we can see the mean of math self-efficacy in each group roughly correlateswith its first exam score, with a higher level math self-efficacy leading to a higher score in the first exam. But nosuch relationship is observed between the math self-efficacy and students’ final exam score.With respect to the use of metacognitive strategy, students in group 3, 1 and 5 were using significantlymore metacognitive strategy than those in group 4, 2 and 6. Especially, students in group 3 reported to use theICLS 2016 Proceedings70© ISLSmetacognitive strategy most frequently, and students in group 2 reported to use at a very low frequency. It isinteresting to notice in Figure 3 that the performance trajectory of group 3, 1 and 5 all presents an increasing trend,while the performance trajectory of group 4, 2, 6 all presents a decreasing trend. It seems that the performancetrajectory may be positively related with the use of metacognitive strategy. The more frequency of the use ofmetacognitive strategy, the more likely the performance would be improved throughout the semester.With respect to the two self-regulatory behaviors – attempts and progress, students in group 6 alwaysranked lowest among six groups on these two behaviors, indicating they enacted significantly less self-regulatorybehaviors during the pre-class online learning than students in other groups. No significant differences were foundamong the rest groups in these two behaviors. Figure 4 demonstrates detailed weekly-self-regulatory behaviors ofthe six groups. As we can see in Figure 4, students in group 6 basically attempted least on the online homeworkin each week and also had the lowest complete view of the online lectures in each week. Based upon theperformance trajectory in Figure 3, the results indicate that the lack of self-regulation on learning behaviors in thepre-class learning setting may lead to the failure of the course.Table 2: Descriptive statistics of three self-regulatory factors in six performance trajectory groupsMSEMetacogAttemptProgressTimeGroup 1(n=38)MeanSD5.87.894.352.241.04.94.43.5082.29 191.51Group 2(n=15)MeanSD5.401.022.052.24.96.91.41.4983.81 201.80Group 3(n=25)MeanSD4.631.174.381.87.971.03.42.4996.20 247.84Group 4(n=34)MeanSD4.741.413.232.10.99.96.36.4888.45 238.71Group 5(n=24)MeanSD4.101.663.692.101.03.96.40.49104.37 157.23Group 6(n=15)MeanSD3.361.291.962.10.83.89.30.4689.29 261.83Figure 4. Students’ weekly self-regulatory behaviors in a semester.Conclusions and implicationsThe present study took an initial step to use both survey research and learning analytics methods to uncover theself-regulated learning process in the pre-class setting of the flipped classroom, and examined the relationshipbetween the self-regulated learning process and students’ performance trajectories during a semester in twoflipped undergraduate math courses. The cluster analysis revealed six different performance trajectory groupsamong students. The analysis of survey and behavioral log data demonstrates that students in these six groups aresignificantly different in the self-regulation process during the pre-class learning. Specifically, math self-efficacyplays a foundational role in the influence of the performance trajectory. Students with higher level math selfefficacy tend to achieve higher in the first exam. However, such the positive relationship does not hold for the restexams. For example, although students in group 2 perceive higher math self-efficacy than those in group 3, they,ICLS 2016 Proceedings71© ISLShowever, achieve lower in all exams except the first one than students in group 3. With respect to the use ofmetacognitive strategy, students who reported as a frequent user of this strategy are more likely to have anincreasing performance trajectory during the semester (e.g. students in group 3), while students who reported torarely use this strategy tend to have a decreasing performance trajectory (e.g. students in group 2). With respectto the regulatory behaviors, students who attempt significantly less on the online homework and only complete asmall proportion of the online lecture review (e.g. students in group 6) are very likely to fail in the flipped courses.The findings from this study have several implications in the field of learning analytics and flippedclassroom research. First, in this study, we have shown that learning analytics method offers a great potential tothe discovery of behavioral and performance trend, such as the performance trajectory presented in this study. Theexamination of the trend, rather than a one-time achievement, provides a more detailed look of students’ learningprocess during a semester and makes it possible to identify relationship between the change in the trend and theself-regulated learning process. Second, the findings in this study suggest that teachers in the flipped class shouldenact tactics to improve or sustain students’ perceived math self-efficacy, such as complimenting their growth,attributing the poor performance to the lack of efforts, and encouraging them try harder. They should also paymore attention to students who rarely involve in the pre-class learning and may provide personal feedback to thesestudents during in-class group work. Most importantly, teachers should implement strategies to enhance students’use of metacognitive strategy, such as providing metacognitive feedback to students when they got wrong in theembedded online quizzes, and helping students reflect on their pre-class learning while facilitating group work inclass.ReferencesAcedo, M.
