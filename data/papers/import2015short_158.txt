We propose acomputational model using ReaderBench that assesses collaboration from a dialogicalperspective. Accordingly, collaboration emerges from the inter-twining of different points ofview or, more specifically, from the inter-animation of voices pertaining to different speakers.Collaboration is determined from the intertwining or overlap of voices emitted by differentparticipants throughout the ongoing conversation. This study presents a validation of thismodel consisting of a comparison between the output of our system and human evaluations of10 chat conversations, selected from a corpus of more than 100 chats, in which ComputerScience students debated on the advantages and disadvantages of CSCL technologies (e.g.,chat, blog, wiki, forum, or Google Wave). The human evaluations of the degree ofcollaboration between the participants and the automated scores showed good overlap asmeasured by precision, recall, and F1 scores. Our overarching conclusion is that dialogismderived from the overlapping of voices can be perceived as a signature for collaboration.Keywords: CSCL, dialogism, collaboration assessment, cohesion, voice inter-animationIntroductionComputer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) technologies, with emphasis on chats and forums, havegained a broader usage as a viable alternative to classic educational scenarios. Such technologies facilitate thedevelopment of learning environments in which knowledge is collaboratively built and shared (Stahl, 2006),based on the inter-twining of collective and individual learning processes (Cress, 2013).Dialogism was introduced by Bakhtin (1981) as having multivocality and polyphony as key features.Koschmann (1999) later proposed dialogism as a paradigm for CSCL. Accordingly, multivocality is centered onthe multitude of meanings and the dialogue between multiple voices, whereas polyphony encapsulates multiplepoints of view and voices while focusing on their inter-animation, as well as the inter-relationships captured intheir co-occurrences and overlap. Wegerif (2006) also considered dialogism as a theoretical starting point thatcan be used for developing tools to teach thinking skills. As Bakhtin (1981) proposed, voices contained withinutterances influence each other, interact one with another and can be reflected one within the other. This processof voice inter-animation occurs progressively from simple repetitions to complex referential relationshipsbetween utterances. In addition, the inter-animation of voices or of personal points of view is a key componentfor ensuring the success of a collaborative learning activity (Wegerif, 2006). However, only a few elaborationsof CSCL models based on dialogism have been proposed, and even fewer approaches provide automaticanalytic tools – e.g., Dong’s design of team communication (Dong, 2005), Polyphony (Trausan-Matu, Rebedea,Dragan, & Alexandru, 2007), or the Knowledge Space Visualizer (Teplovs, 2008).Following from our development of several systems inspired from the dialogical approach (i.e.,PolyCAFe (Trausan-Matu & Rebedea, 2010; Dascalu, Rebedea, Trausan-Matu, & Armitt, 2011; Trausan-Matu,Dascalu, & Rebedea, 2014) and ReaderBench (Dascalu, Trausan-Matu, & Dessus, 2013a), we propose acomputational model to assess collaboration based on the inter-twining or overlap of voices pertaining todifferent speakers, therefore enabling a transversal analysis of subsequent discussion slices. We present a largescale validation consisting of a comparison between the output of our system and human evaluations. Inaddition, we describe the results of a study with multi-participant chat conversations in which members wereasked to debate on given topics and were assessed in terms of the collaboration among themselves. Ouroverarching conclusion is that dialogism derived from the overlapping of voices can be perceived as a signaturefor collaboration.CSCL 2015 Proceedings86© ISLSPhilosophical implications of dialogism and the polyphonic modelDialogism was introduced by Bakhtin (1981, 1984) and is centered on dialogue reflected in “any kind of humansense-making, semiotic practice, action, interaction, thinking or communication” (Linell, 2009, pp. 5-6). Thisdefinition of dialogism is naturally focused on the dialogue between two or more individuals exchangingutterances, but may well be present in any text as “life by its very nature is dialogic … when dialogue ends,everything ends” (Bakhtin, 1984, p. 294). In addition, dialogue can be also perceived from a more abstractperspective as having multiple valences: ‘internal dialogue within the self’ or ‘internal dialogue’ (Linell, 2009,ch. 6), ‘dialogical exploration of the environment’ (Linell, 2009, ch. 7), ‘dialogue with artifacts’ (Linell, 2009,ch. 16), ‘dialogue between ideas’ (Marková, Linell, Grossen, & Salazar Orvig, 2007, ch. 6) or ‘paradigms’(Linell, 2005, ch. 6). Nevertheless, in each context, discourse is modeled from a dialogical perspective asinteraction with others, essentially towards building meaning and understanding.In order to properly introduce the polyphonic model presented in detail later on within this section, wemust first present the three core and inter-dependent concepts of discourse analysis: utterances briefly defined asunits of analysis, voices as distinctive points of view emerging from the ongoing discussion, and echoes as thereplication of a certain voice, the overtones and repetitions of the specific point of view that occur later on, withfurther implications in the discourse. Although the complexity of an utterance may vary greatly from a simpleword or exchange to a set of inter-twined utterances or even to an entire novel (Bakhtin, 1986), our analysisadheres to Dong’s perspective of separating utterances based on turn-taking events between speakers (Dong,2009). Therefore, introducing a new point of view or contribution from a different participant divides thediscourse by potentially modifying the inner, ongoing perspective of the current speaker. At a more fine-grainedlevel, words, seen as the constituents of utterances, provide the liaisons between utterances and deepen theperspective of others’ contributions into one’s discourse. Obviously, utterances may contain more than a singlevoice, as well as alien voices to which the current voice refers (Trausan-Matu & Stahl, 2007). An alien voice ispart of a turn uttered by a given participant that is later replicated in another one, marking therefore the transferamong different participants and their corresponding points of view with regards to the voice’s central word.Therefore, the main goal of a discussion can be described in terms of voice inter-animation andachieving true polyphony (Bakhtin, 1984) in which conflicting views, various angles, and multiple perspectivesconcur; all the previous aspects should also be covered in a truly collaborative conversation. However, as voicesexpress ideas and opinions, polyphony can be used to perform a deep dialogical discourse analysis by summingup multiple voices co-occurring within the same discussion thread.Nevertheless, we must also emphasize an intrinsic problem that “it is indeed impossible to be‘completely dialogical’, if one wants to be systematic and contribute to a cumulative scientific endeavor”(Linell, 2009, p. 383). The later point of view also augments the duality between individual involvement andactual collaboration throughout a given CSCL conversation, as it is impossible to focus on both the animationwith other participants’ utterances and sustainably provide meaningful contributions. In the end, a balance needsto be achieved between individuals, without facing discourse domination in terms of participation.The polyphonic model (Trausan-Matu, Stahl, & Zemel, 2005; Trausan-Matu & Stahl, 2007; TrausanMatu et al., 2014) follows the ideas of Koschmann (1999) and Wegerif (2005) and investigates how Bakhtin’stheory of polyphony and inter-animation (Bakhtin, 1981, 1984) can be used for analyzing the discourse in chatconversations with multiple participants for which classic approaches are not appropriate. Therefore, thepolyphonic model focuses on the idea of identifying voices in the analysis of discourse and building an internalgraph-based representation, whether relying on the utterance graph (Trausan-Matu et al., 2007) or the cohesiongraph (Dascalu et al., 2013a). To this end, links between utterances are analyzed using repetitions, lexical andsemantic chains, as well as cohesive links, and a graph is built in order to highlight discussion threads.Nevertheless, in both internal representations, lexical or semantic cohesion between any two utterances can beconsidered the central liaison between the analysis elements within the graph.Moreover, of particular interest is the multi-dimensionality of the polyphonic model (Trausan-Matu,2013). First, the longitudinal dimension is reflected in the explicit or implicit references between utterances,following the conversation timeline. This grants an overall image of the degree of inter-animation of voicesspanning the discourse. This polyphony can now be used as a signature for collaboration, as the interactionsbetween multiple participants of the conversation are reflected in their voices. Second, threading highlightsvoices evolution in terms of the interaction with other discussion threads. Third, the transversal dimension isuseful for observing a differential positioning of participants, when a shift of their point of interest occurstowards discussing other topics.CSCL 2015 Proceedings87© ISLSDialogical voice inter-animation modelFrom a computational perspective, until recently, the goals of discourse analysis in existing approaches orientedtowards conversations analysis were to detect topics and links (Adams & Martell, 2008), dialog acts(Kontostathis et al., 2009), lexical chains (Dong, 2006), or other complex relations (Rosé et al., 2008). Thepolyphonic model emphasizes the Natural Language Processing dimension of the analysis by taking fulladvantage of Latent Semantic Analysis (Landauer & Dumais, 1997), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei, Ng, &Jordan, 2003), semantic distances from the lexicalized ontology WordNet (Budanitsky & Hirst, 2006), andSocial Network Analysis (Wasserman & Faust, 1994).The voice identification process resides in building lexical chains and merging them into semanticchains through cohesion (Dascalu, Trausan-Matu, & Dessus, 2013b). Due to the limitation of discovering lexicalchains (Galley & McKeown, 2003) through semantic distances in ontologies (Budanitsky & Hirst, 2006) thatonly consider words having the same part-of-speech, the merge step is essential as it enables consideration ofdifferent parts-of-speech and unites groups of concepts based on identical lemmas or high cohesion values.Therefore, an iterative algorithm similar to an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm (Hastie,Tibshirani, & Friedman, 2009) is used. In order to merge clusters, the algorithm starts from the identified lexicalchains seen as groups of already clustered words and uses the cohesion between the corresponding groups ofwords as the distance function if this value is greater than an imposed threshold.As semantic chains span across the discourse, the context generated by the co-occurrence or repetitionsof tightly cohesive concepts is similar to the longitudinal dimension of voices. Echoes can be highlightedthrough cohesion based on semantic similarity, while the attenuation effect is reflected in the considereddistance between analysis elements. Moreover, by inter-twining different semantic chains within the sameutterance, we are able to better grasp the transversal dimension of voice inter-animation. Therefore, aftermanually selecting the voices of interest, the user can visualize the conversation as an overlap of co-occurringsemantic chains that induce polyphony (see Figure 1). The chart follows the conversation timeline expressed inutterance identifiers and a voice is displayed within the interface as the three most dominant concepts (wordlemmas). Different speakers that uttered a particular voice are demarcated with randomly assigned colors,consistent throughout a conversation for each participant.Figure 1. Voices (e.g., chat - conversation) split per participant and their corresponding distributions throughoutthe conversation.In order to achieve genuine collaboration, the conversation must contain threads of utterancesintegrating key concepts or ‘voices’, that inter-animate in a similar way to counterpoints in polyphonic musicalfugues (Trausan-Matu et al., 2005; Trausan-Matu & Stahl, 2007). As collaboration is centered on multipleparticipants, a split of each voice into multiple viewpoints pertaining to different participants is required. Aviewpoint consists of a link between the concepts pertaining to a voice and a participant, through their explicituse within one’s contributions in the ongoing conversation. We opted to present this split in terms of implicit(alien) voices (Trausan-Matu & Stahl, 2007) (see Figure 1), as the accumulation of voices through transitivity ininter-linked cohesive utterances clearly highlights the presence of alien voices. In addition, this splitCSCL 2015 Proceedings88© ISLSpresentation of semantic chains per participant is useful for observing each speaker’s coverage and distributionof dominant concepts throughout the conversation.After identifying the semantic chains that become voices and, in accordance to Miller’s law (1956), asimple moving average (Upton & Cook, 2008) was applied on the voice distribution for five datum pointsrepresenting consecutive utterances, with a split horizon of one minute between adjacent contributions. In otherwords, we weighted the importance of each concept occurrence over five adjacent utterances if there were nobreaks in the discourse larger than an imposed, experimentally determined, threshold of one minute. Exceedingthis value would clearly mark a stopping point in the overall chat conversation, making the expansion of thesingular occurrence of the voice over this break unnecessary. This step of smoothing the initial discrete voicedistribution plays a central role in subsequent processing as the expanded context of a voice’s occurrence ismuch more significant than the sole consideration of the concept uttered by a participant in a given contribution.Moreover, by applying pointwise mutual information (PMI) (Fano, 1961) between the moving averagesof all pairs of voice distributions that appear in a given context of five analysis elements, we obtained a localdegree of voice inter-weaving or synergy (Dascalu et al., 2013b). Therefore, collaboration is assessed as thecumulated PMI value obtained from all possible pairs of voices pertaining to different participants (differentviewpoints) within subsequent contexts of the analysis. From an individual point of view, each participant’soverall collaboration is computed as the cumulated mutual information between an individual’s personalviewpoints and all other participant viewpoints. In other words, by comparing individual voice distributions thatspan throughout the conversation, collaboration emerges from the overlap of voices pertaining to differentparticipants.Figure 2. Collaboration evolution viewed as voice overlap between different participants (intertwining ofdifferent viewpoints), including the automatic identification of intense collaboration zones in contrast to theconversation timeline and utterance distribution.Figure 2 presents the voices with the longest semantic chain span throughout the conversation anddisplays the tight correlation between the conversation’s time evolution depicting the links from the cohesiongraph (Dascalu et al., 2013a) among participants’ utterances ordered chronologically and the results from ourcollaboration assessment model. A high density of links between participants determines collaboration, whereastimeframes with monologues from a single participant (e.g., utterances with IDs ranging from 27 to 50) havelimited or no collaboration. Afterwards, collaboration increases as multiple participants become involved in theongoing discussion. In addition, within the cumulated contextual PMI view, all of the voices from theconversation are considered (even those that have as low as 3 constituent words); this explains the greaterCSCL 2015 Proceedings89© ISLScumulative values encountered in the graph. Each peak of collaboration obtained through PMI corresponds to azone with a high transversal density of voices emitted by different speakers (e.g., utterances with IDs rangingfrom 95 to 105 from the following excerpt that involves all participants involved in the conversation):Cristian:Marian:Cristian:Marian:Marian:Madalin:Marian:Delia:one thing about wiki. it is easy for many people to post on themyou can also find good information on forumsbut if no one is keeping tab on the content it can get pretty confusingand you can also search for information on forumsand anyone can post on forumsin forums knowledge tends to be dispersed and somewhat lower in densityI agreeme tooValidations of collaboration and the identification of collaboration zonesThe validation experiment focuses on the assessment of 10 chat conversations, selected from a corpus of morethan 100 chats, that took place in an academic environment in which Computer Science students from the 4thyear undergoing the Human-Computer Interaction course at our university debated on the advantages anddisadvantages of CSCL technologies (e.g., chat, blog, wiki, forum, or Google Wave). Each conversationinvolved 4 or 5 participants who each first debated on the benefits and disadvantages of a given technology, andthen later proposing an integrated alternative that encompassed the previously presented advantages.Afterwards, 110 4th year undergraduate and master students were asked to manually annotate 3 chatconversations, grading each participant on a 1-10 scale in terms of collaboration (inter-change of ideas withother participants) and identifying intense collaboration zones as segments of the conversations with a highdegree of collaboration among the participants.We opted to distribute the evaluation of each conversation due to the high amount of time it takes tomanually assess a single discussion (on average, users reported 1.5 to 4 hours for a deep understanding)(Trausan-Matu, 2010). In the end, we had on average 33 annotations per conversation and the overall resultspresented in Table 1 indicate a reliable automatic evaluation of collaboration. The high values of intra-classcorrelations (ICC) and Cronbach's alpha (see Table 1) between the evaluators of each chat indicate fewdisagreements between raters. Pearson correlations and non-parametric correlations (Spearman’s Rho) weredetermined between automatic and human mean ratings for each conversation. The preliminary results of theexperiments presented in detail in this paper were included in Dascalu, Trausan-Matu, and Dessus (2014).Table 1.

All manual annotations were afterwards cumulated in a histogram that presented, foreach utterance, the number of raters who considered it to be part of an intense collaboration zone. In the end, agreedy algorithm (Dascalu et al., 2013a) was applied on this histogram in order to obtain an aggregated versionthat reflected the intense collaboration zones emerging as an overlap of all annotations (see third column ofTable 2). Based on the highlighted intense collaboration zones from Table 2, there is a good overlap reflected inthe number of utterances marked as pertaining to a collaboration zone in both manual and automatic processes,as well as in terms of accuracy measured as precision, recall, and F1 score between the annotated collaborationzones and our dialogical model. This indicates that our polyphonic-dialogic model is a good estimator of theannotated zones, therefore demonstrating the feasibility of our approach.Conclusions and future research directionsBased on dialogism and on the polyphonic model, we have devised an automatic method capable of identifyingcollaboration based on the inter-animation of voices. As the validations demonstrated the accuracy of themodels built on dialogism, we can state that the proposed methods emphasize the dialogical perspective ofcollaboration in CSCL environments. We opted to present the evolution of voice synergy through PMI insteadof polyphony because our computational model uses co-occurrences and the overlap of voices within a givenCSCL 2015 Proceedings91© ISLScontext. In order to emphasize the effect of inter-animation that would induce true polyphony, we envisage theuse of argumentation acts and patterns (Stent & Allen, 2000) for highlighting the interdependencies betweenvoices and how a particular voice can shed light on another.This approach opens up the exploration of multiple research questions. For example, one line of ourresearch will further examine the relations between student collaboration in chat forums and performance in online courses. We also envision the use of this approach to assess narrative features of novels, highlightingdifferent points of view from different characters. Still further, another set of experiments might focus on theassessment of students’ self-explanations that can be perceived as a ‘dialogue’ between the author’s text andstudents’ thoughts viewed as echoes of the voices from the initial text, highlighting in the end relevant readingstrategies employed by the learner (e.g., paraphrases, bridging, or knowledge inference). In sum, our approachopens up a host of opportunities to further explore collaboration from a dialogical perspective across a widerange of contexts.ReferencesAdams, P.H., & Martell, C.H. (2008).
