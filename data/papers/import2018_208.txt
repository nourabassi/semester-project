Blending Mathematical and Physical Negative-nessTra Huynh, Kansas State University, trahuynh@ksu.eduEleanor C. Sayre, Kansas State University, esayre@gmail.comAbstract: Expressing physics problems in the form of a mathematical model is one of the mostimportant stages in the problem-solving process. Particularly in algebraic symbolization,understanding the meanings of signs and being able to manipulate them becomes a challengingtask for students, especially when more than two elements in the mathematical expression couldcarry a negative sign. We use Conceptual Blending theory to investigate how students attributeemergent meaning to the signs and how they articulate different signs in their algebraicsymbolization. The data for this research is drawn from oral exams of students enrolled in upperdivision physics. The results shed light on students’ understanding of algebraic symbols andtheir competence in formulating and manipulating them.IntroductionMathematics is the common language of science, including physics. By the time university students takeintermediate physics, they normally have mastered algebra and practiced calculus in the prerequisite math courses.Accordingly, the mathematical difficulties they usually encounter are appropriately ascribed to the link betweenmathematical expression and the physical meaning that they are trying to make. Considerable research in physicseducation research (PER) is devoted to investigating the relationship between math and physics, especially howstudents use math to express physics concepts and tell physical stories. Conceptual blending (Fouconnier &Turner, 2002) provides a framework where the idea and structure from multiple input domains are blended togenerate new meaning, and thus helps us to investigate how students blend mathematics and physics conceptualknowledge. Previous research on math in physics contexts (Bing & Redish, 2007; Hu & Rebello, 2013) arguesthat students can construct more effective blends through better mapping. Thus, student difficulties might not bebecause of lacking prerequisite skills but rather because of the inappropriate blending of math, physics knowledge,and the physical scenario at hand. Other work (Gire & Price, 2014) also uses blending theory to show how studentsmake conceptual meaning of electric field vectors. The difficulty occurs when students’ represented vector fieldsin space are also attributed to the clash between input spaces; that is, when an input element (e.g., spatial extent)could represent two meanings simultaneously (distance in coordinate space and magnitude of the field).In this study, we focus on students in an upper-division Electromagnetism I course with heavy use ofmathematics to understand electric and magnetic fields. As a group, their mathematical skills and physicsintuitions are substantially more advanced than introductory students, but they still encounter algebraic difficultieswith negative signs. The negative sign and its associated concepts in learning and teaching have been studiedextensively in k12 contexts back to 1972, but not with upper-division, math-heavy science students. When itcomes to electromagnetic topics, the negative sign could be affiliated with different possible elements, such as thecharge, vector field, etc. We use conceptual blending theory to account for the meaning that students associatewith the sign and to explain the difficulties they face when they manipulate all negative signs at the same time.MethodsWe collected video data of oral exams done by students in an undergraduate upper-division Electromagnetism Icourse which enrolls about 20 senior physics students and covers the theory of electric and magnetic fields invacuum and matter. Our data are drawn from the first oral exam in the fourth week of class, after the class hascovered major topics such as Coulomb’s law, Gauss' law, and the method of separation of variables.In an oral exam (Sayre, 2014), students individually work on the board and are encouraged to talk andexplain their reasoning to the instructor as they move through the problem. The problem they are exploring isfinding the electric field on an axis caused by two equal and opposite charges located on the same axis. Theproblem appears superficially easy -- it is often given to introductory students -- but requires careful attention tothe sign of algebraic expressions and high expectations of consistency among different directions, values, andsigns. Four students (all male; three white, one Asian) solve this problem as part of their exam and none of themsucceed on their first attempt. The similar struggles across all students become a salient point requiringinvestigation of students’ competence to deal with algebraic signs. We perform moment-by-moment analysis toinvestigate students’ reasoning and construct multiple blends to obtain different emergent meanings that studentendow the sign with. In this paper, we introduce a case study on one student whose reasoning is typical of hispeers and who eventually arrives successfully at the correct answer.ICLS 2018 Proceedings957© ISLSBlending between directionality and signConceptual blending theory accounts for how people formulate meaning. Blending, the central action of thetheory, is a mental operation of a mental network that generates new meaning. The network consists of at leasttwo input spaces containing information from discrete domains, a generic space containing the common structureand information between input spaces, and a blended space where the new information, whose structure does notexist in any input, emerges. A blending process of generating new meaning has three stages (composition,completion, and elaboration), mostly happening at the subconscious level.We propose three different blends among the directionality and the algebraic signs, which lead to threedifferent emergent meanings that cover the situation at hand. Because these two input spaces may producedifferent blends that lead to different conclusions about the physics, we contend that this problem is difficultbecause selecting the appropriate blend is difficult, not because of an inherent difficulty in choosing input spacesor building each blend. Because vectors have both magnitude and direction, a full analysis of students' blendingas they figure out electric fields would require blends for both the magnitude of the vectors and their direction.Observationally, we notice that students tend to treat magnitude as a separate problem as direction, so for brevitywe focus only on their directionality reasoning here.Figure 1. Three blends between directionality and sign. From left to right: for space-fixed coordinates,for body-fixed coordinates, and for comparing the signs of vectors.In each blend, there are two input spaces which are main characters in our problem, directionality and sign. Thefirst blend runs when a space-fixed problem is involved, for example a coordinate axis in a one-dimensionalproblem. The axis could be positive leftward or rightward. From directionality, rightward and leftward map topositive and negative (respectively) from sign, projecting forward the convention that leftward is negative andrightward is positive. Running the blend yields a vector (e.g. 𝑥𝑥⃗) which is positive when it points to the right. Thisis the usual convention for one-dimensional space-fixed coordinate systems in physics.Alternately, one could select away and towards from directionality to map to positive and negative insign (respectively). This is common in body-fixed coordinate systems: moving away from me is positive velocityand moving towards me is negative; radial vectors are positive away from the source. In the case of the electricfield caused by a charge, we add the effect of the sign of the charge into the blend with directionality and sign. Inthis further blend (not pictured) a positive charge maps to the positive-away part of the blended directionalitysign space, generating a blend where the electric field of a positive charge points away from the charge.Another significant emergent meaning of the sign comes from the relative direction of two vectors,shown on the right in Figure 1. The characteristics of directionality are now “sameness” or “differentness”. In aone-dimensional system, "different" and "opposite" are the same, so we kept the label of the more general case.Formally, the association with the sign might come from the mathematical property of the inner product of twovectors; the inner product of two opposite vectors is negative. Apart from comparing the sign of 𝑥𝑥�, 𝐸𝐸� , and 𝑅𝑅� , (thedistance vector from the point charge to the field point), the meaning emerged from this comparative blend alsosometimes shows up when students consider the interference of two fields. For instance, 𝐸𝐸�⃗1 and 𝐸𝐸�⃗2 are destructiveif their directions are opposite and thus one can insert a negative sign accordingly to account for thatdestructiveness in the expression for the total field strength. Noting that, the constructiveness and destructivenessare inherently affiliated with the relative direction meaning. Therefore, using these associations requiresconsistency and care to not double account for this meaning.Example and analysisOliver, our case study student, uses math explicitly to show exactly what he thinks of each element in theexpression. Additionally, he is also good at thinking out loud and expressing his thoughts in detail.The problem is given to Oliver in both verbal and diagrammatic forms. “Suppose we have two chargesat -a and +a [as per the charges in figure 2]. What does the electric field look like along the x-axis?” The problemICLS 2018 Proceedings958© ISLSis typically solved by dividing the whole region into three regions: left of both charges, right of both, and theregion between them. The electric field contribution from each charge varies in each region both in direction andmagnitude and is commonly drawn like the arrows in figure 2. The total electric field will obey the principle ofsuperposition in all regions.Table 1: Oliver’s solutionTime17:56210:53312:18413:15515:36617:56719:30Mathematical expression𝐸𝐸�⃗ = 𝐸𝐸−𝑞𝑞 +𝐸𝐸𝑞𝑞 = k𝐸𝐸1 = k[(𝑥𝑥+𝑎𝑎)2−𝑞𝑞(𝑥𝑥+𝑎𝑎)2−𝑞𝑞–k𝐸𝐸1 = k[(𝑥𝑥+𝑎𝑎)2 +𝑞𝑞𝐸𝐸1 = k[(𝑥𝑥+𝑎𝑎)2 −−𝑞𝑞−𝑞𝑞𝑞𝑞𝑥𝑥� + k(𝑥𝑥−𝑎𝑎)2𝑞𝑞(𝑥𝑥−𝑎𝑎)2𝑞𝑞(𝑥𝑥−𝑎𝑎)2𝑞𝑞(𝑥𝑥−𝑎𝑎)2] 𝑥𝑥�BlendBlend for body-fixed coordinate,blend of comparing 𝑥𝑥� and 𝑅𝑅�Blend of comparing 𝐸𝐸�𝑞𝑞 and 𝐸𝐸�−𝑞𝑞(destructiveness)Blend of comparing 𝐸𝐸�𝑞𝑞 and 𝐸𝐸�−𝑞𝑞𝑥𝑥�] 𝑥𝑥�] 𝑥𝑥�Blend of comparing 𝐸𝐸�𝑞𝑞 , 𝐸𝐸�−𝑞𝑞 , and 𝑥𝑥�𝑞𝑞𝐸𝐸2 = 𝑘𝑘 (𝑥𝑥+𝑎𝑎)2 (−𝑥𝑥�) + 𝑘𝑘 (𝑥𝑥−𝑎𝑎)2 (−𝑥𝑥�)11𝐸𝐸2 = 𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘[(𝑥𝑥+𝑎𝑎)2 + (𝑥𝑥−𝑎𝑎)2](−𝑥𝑥�)𝑞𝑞𝑞𝑞−𝑞𝑞𝑞𝑞𝐸𝐸3 = 𝑘𝑘 �(𝑥𝑥+𝑎𝑎)2 (−𝑥𝑥�) + 𝑘𝑘 (𝑥𝑥−𝑎𝑎)2 𝑥𝑥�� = 𝑘𝑘[(𝑥𝑥+𝑎𝑎)2 + (𝑥𝑥−𝑎𝑎)2]𝑥𝑥�Blend for body-fixed coordinate,blend of comparing 𝑥𝑥� and 𝑅𝑅�Blend of comparing 𝐸𝐸�𝑞𝑞 , 𝐸𝐸�−𝑞𝑞 , and 𝑥𝑥�Blend of comparing 𝐸𝐸�𝑞𝑞 , 𝐸𝐸�−𝑞𝑞 , and 𝑥𝑥�Oliver starts by writing down the superposition formula of the total electric field: 𝐸𝐸�⃗ = E q + E -q , andmoves to define each contribution using Coulomb's Law, as is appropriate to the problem (Table 1). It takes hima long time to decide what the denominator looks like so that it is consistent with the definition of 𝑅𝑅� . The formula𝑞𝑞of the electric field due to a point charge 𝐸𝐸�⃗ = k 2 𝑅𝑅� suggests Oliver should blend the charges’ value with the𝑅𝑅direction of the electric field vector and compare the distance vector 𝑅𝑅� to 𝑥𝑥�. Then, as Oliver thinks that “𝑅𝑅� is alongx direction”, a positive sign which is commensurate with the “sameness” in 𝑅𝑅� and 𝑥𝑥� direction is added while hereplaces 𝑅𝑅� by 𝑥𝑥�. Oliver concludes that the total electric field along the x axis will be as shown in line 1. We seethat Oliver could have arrived at the correct answer if he defined correctly the relationship between 𝑅𝑅� and 𝑥𝑥� foreach charge. However, as vector 𝑅𝑅� is not clearly shown on the diagram, this output from the blend of comparing𝑅𝑅� and 𝑥𝑥� leads to an array of confusion and conflict with other blends that he uses later.Figure 2. Diagram with the two charges on the x-axis at +/- a. Regions 1-3 and the origin O are marked, andthe blue arrows designate the direction of the electric field in each region.Noticing that the electric field of the positive charge does not always point in the 𝑥𝑥� direction as shownin his mathematical expression, Oliver decides to divide the given region into three smaller ones and defines thefield vectors on the diagram, as shown in Figure 2. With the diagram, the blend of comparing the vectors,especially 𝐸𝐸� and 𝑥𝑥�, can be run easily and becomes more trustful to Oliver compared to other blends. Later, weobserve him trying to fit the sign coming from other blends with this one.In region 1, Oliver quickly realizes that the contribution of the negative charge to any field point is greaterthan that of the positive charge. He inserts a negative sign between the two terms accounting for the effect ofdestructiveness of two component fields as they are in opposite directions. He concludes: “It would be this term[E - q ] minus this term [E q ]” (line 2). However, as he is halfway through recording the expression on the board,Oliver expresses suspicion because both terms are now negative. This result clearly conflicts with their relativedirection because he has double associated their opposite direction with inappropriate application ofdestructiveness. Oliver tries hard to determine where another negative sign could come from, such as thedenominator, to cancel one negative sign for the whole term. Finally, he decides to absorb the destructive meaningof the sign into the opposite-direction meaning of the electric field vector and changes the second negative signof the whole term back into the plus sign (line 3), which supports the fact that they are in opposite directions.ICLS 2018 Proceedings959© ISLSHowever, Oliver has not considered the sign commensurate with the relative direction of 𝐸𝐸� and 𝑥𝑥�, leading to hissolution having the opposite sign to the correct answer.Reading off the physical sense of Oliver’s mathematical expression again, the instructor points out thatE q is pointing in the 𝑥𝑥� direction. Oliver starts getting frustrated. He knows that the final solution should have anegative sign in E q to be consistent with the blend of comparing 𝐸𝐸� and 𝑥𝑥� that is obviously shown on the diagram.However, Oliver gets stuck manipulating the signs coming from all the sources and ascribes a general meaning tothe final sign left in the expression. Eventually, Oliver changes the sign of the terms such that they agree with theemergent meaning of comparative blend between 𝐸𝐸� and 𝑥𝑥�. Oliver confirms his final solution (line 4) and explainshis line of reasoning: “Because… see the charges, I should have just figured it out […] which direction it is. Thisis exactly what is changing the signs, not necessarily the sign of the charge.” In other words, Oliver hassuccessfully affiliated the sign’s meaning of the effect of charge on the field and the superposition into the sign’smeaning of the relative direction among component electric fields and 𝑥𝑥�.Moving to the other two regions, we observe Oliver encounter the same struggles with multiple meaningsof the sign; however, he's faster at selecting productive blends. Rewriting the mathematical expression in such away that the minus signs are put next to the elements they belong to (line 5) helps Oliver better distinguish andunderstand the meaning of the signs. Eventually, deciding to be consistent with the blend of comparing the relativedirection of component electric field and 𝑥𝑥�, Oliver arrives at the correct answers for regions 2 and 3, noting thathe should “not worry about the sign [of charge], just worry about the field point [field direction]” (line 6, line 7).Discussion and conclusionAs shown in the case study, the problem of two charges appears easy but requires effort and consistency inconsidering where the signs belong and their meaning. Oliver typically struggles with combining ideas whichseems to be easy. Using conceptual blending, we look at the fine-grained structure of the sign and thus, explorehis reasoning meticulously, and how he successfully blends the physical and mathematical sign.We have associated the algebraic sign with three different meanings in this electrostatics problem, whichemerges from three blends of directionality with signs. In the cases of electric field with interference, the signcharge input and the constructiveness or destructiveness also play a role in the blend. We argue that thechallenging part of this problem is attributed to the complexity of selecting different blends for sign anddirectionality. The sign could be affiliated with the relationship among 𝐸𝐸� , q, 𝑅𝑅� , and 𝑥𝑥�, or with any of themindividually. The student in this case study shows his strong competence in negative number arithmetic, forexample, operation of multiplication. However, to successfully deal with algebraic signs, the student has neededto recognize these different blends and productively select among them. In the literature of using conceptualblending theory in science education research, this difficulty could be explained by the clash between differentinput spaces, where a sign, either positive or negative, could carry multiple meanings in a comparative blend.The sign is not the only problematic algebraic element in this problem. The other students in our dataalso struggled with determining the distance from the two point-charges to field point in different regions.However, as we are interested in how students work on the meaning of the negative sign, we purposefully pickedOliver, who had much less confusion about the distance, and focused on his reasoning on charge and directionality.The problem of introductory level problems when introduced to intermediate-level students helps exposestudents’ understanding of mathematics and their competence in using mathematics to express physical concepts.The salient algebraic complexity of this problem has suggested these types of problems could be an interestingelectromagnetism problem in physics education research, leading to greater insight into student algebraic thinking.ReferencesBing, T.
