Investigating the Coupling of Narrative and Localityin Augmented Reality Educational Activities:Effects on Students’ Immersion and Learning GainsYiannis Georgiou and Eleni A. KyzaIoannis.Georgiou@cut.ac.cy, Eleni.Kyza@cut.ac.cyMedia, Cognition and Learning Research Group, Cyprus University of TechnologyAbstract: The popularity of Augmented Reality (AR) technologies is on the rise, yet little isknown about the design principles which could support immersion and learning in suchcontexts. This study investigated the hypothesis that greater coupling between the physicalspace and the narrative of the AR activity leads to enhanced immersion and learning. Forty-fivemiddle school students participated in this study: students in Condition1 (n=22) participated inan AR activity with strong coupling between the narrative and the physical space, while studentsin Condition2 (n=23) participated in a loose coupling version of the activity. Data collectionincluded baseline data, questionnaires investigating students’ immersion and learning gains, aswell as post-activity interviews. Findings showed higher learning gains and increasedimmersion for the students participating in the strong coupling condition than for the studentsin the loose coupling condition.Introduction and theoretical backgroundNarrative-based AR activities have been argued to be effective in engaging students in science learning due totheir immersive affordances (Dunleavy et al. 2009). Conceptualizing immersion as a gradated process of cognitiveand emotional involvement, researchers have argued that feelings of presence (feeling surrounded by a blendedyet realistic physical/virtual environment), and flow (being fully absorbed in the activity), are considered asindicators of full immersion and can be powerful contributors to learning (Cheng et al., 2015). Previous studieshave provided empirical evidence arguing that such heightened levels of immersion in narrative-based ARactivities can increase students’ performance and subsequent science learning (e.g., Georgiou & Kyza, 2017a).Despite such reports, little is yet known about design principles which can contribute to more engaging ARlearning activities, inducing higher levels of immersion.Reid, Cater, Fleuriot, and Hull (2005a) were the first ones who argued that the coupling between physicalspace and narrative may affect the external realism of the narrative resulting in different levels of immersion inmobile-based activities. Reid et al. (2005a) distinguished between three “levels of significance to a place”: (a)arbitrary linkage, (b) physicality, and (c) particular location. At the first level, there is no connection between thephysical space and the mediated experience. At the Physicality level “there are certain features of a place that aresignificant, but the actual geography is not important”, and at the “Particular location” level “the actual locationand physical artefacts in a place are significant and meaningful” to the experience (p. 28). Based on thisdistinction, Karapanos Barreto, Nisi, and Niforatos (2012) have proposed that, from a design-based perspective,this may result in (a) mobile-based activities with a strong coupling, as they are enacted at the original locationthat is directly related to the narrative, and (b) mobile-based activities with a loose coupling, as they are enactedat a location that simply induces the same atmosphere with the narrative.Existing studies, primarily from the Human-Computer Interaction field, yield inconclusive findings forthe coupling phenomenon. Reid, Hull, Cater, and Fleuriot (2005b) investigated users’ immersive experiences in“Riot!1831”, a situated-based interactive drama employing a location-aware, mobile application. According totheir findings, the users’ immersion was highly increased during the moments where there was strong couplingbetween the events in the narrative plot, as it unfolded in the virtual space, and the physical world. According toReid et al. (2005), during moments of high immersion “the senses are heightened to the coincidence of the eventand it feels almost supernatural, as if events in the virtual world have somehow moved across into the physicalworld” (p. 291). Karapanos et al. (2012) compared the degree of immersion and presence of location-basednarratives in different settings and found that the condition with the highest coupling between the place and thenarrative resulted in a more immersive experience. However, they did not find statistically significant differencesin regard to feelings of presence. Karapanos et al. (2012) explained this latter finding by discussing the limitationsof their study, such as the use of a non-standardized scale with a single-item for measuring presence, or the shortduration (3 minutes) of the narrative-based activity, which may have contributed to the findings of their study. Ina more recent study, Rossitto, Barkhuus and Engström (2016) presented an evaluation of a location-based ARdrama activity. Even though the narrative of the activity was loosely-coupled with the physical location where itICLS 2018 Proceedings392© ISLSunfolded, the users were able to imagine possible ways for interweaving the story with the place. Based on thesefindings, Rossito et al. (2016) concluded that this process of interpretation and sense-making between the narrativeand the space, resulted in a highly immersive experience in this loosely-coupled activity.Taking into account that existing evidence regarding how coupling influences immersion is inconclusive,the present study compared the effects of two types of coupling (strong/loose) and sought to answer the followingresearch questions: (a) Does the level of semantic coupling influence how students experience immersion? (b)Does the level of semantic coupling have a different impact on what students learn? (c) What are the main factorsaffecting students’ immersion, in terms of flow and presence, for each type of semantic coupling?MethodologyThis study adopted an experimental research design, which included two groups of middle school age students.Each group of students was randomly assigned to one of two semantic coupling conditions: (Condition1: Stronglycoupled AR educational activity, Condition2: Loosely-coupled AR educational activity). A cross-comparisonmethod was employed for investigating students’ immersion and learning gains in each condition.ParticipantsPartici pantsFifty-five middle school students, who were enrolled in a summer camp at a public university, participated in thisstudy. Data from ten students were removed from the corpus as the students had missed key activities, resultingto a final sample of forty-five students (n=45). Students were randomly assigned to each condition. Condition1had 22 students (13 boys, 59.1%) and Condition2 had 23 students (12 boys, 52.2%). The mean age in Condition1was 12.3 years, and the mean age in Condition2 was 11.7 years; there was no statistically significant differencein students’ age between the two conditions (Z=-1.50, p=.135) nor in the baseline assessment (described later).InterventionStudents in both conditions used the “Mysterious disease” marker-based AR activity; the activity was based onQuick Response (QR) codes and took place at one of the university buildings. The AR activity was a narrativedriven investigation running on Android tablets, and its duration was 45 minutes. Students were randomly dividedin pairs and were assigned the task to collaboratively investigate a case regarding the outburst of a mysteriousdisease at the university. The pedagogical goal of the AR activity was to engage students in an explanationbuilding process about the problem-based case, and support students’ understanding of scientific concepts relatedto the nature of microbes (e.g. types, characteristics, etc.) and the transmission of pathogens. Upon the activationof each QR code, students had access to video-based characters (e.g., university nurse, professor of microbiology,health services agent), whο provided them with access to information on different aspects of the learning topic,including relevant evidence. According to the narrative, the mysterious disease was caused by a massive foodpoisoning due to insufficient adherence to food safety procedures at the university cafeteria. Since the goal of thisstudy was to investigate the impact of loosely-coupled and strongly-coupled AR activities on students’ immersionand subsequent learning, two different versions of the “Mysterious disease” AR activity were developed: astrongly-coupled version and a loosely-coupled version; students in each condition participated in a differentversion of the activity.The strongly-coupled AR activityThe strongly-coupled version of the activity explicitly intended to increase the relation of the content in the mobileenvironment and the physical space in two ways (Figures 1 and 2).Figure 1. Students participating in the stronglycoupled activity collect data from a real notepad.ICLS 2018 ProceedingsFigure 2. Students participating in the stronglycoupled activity in the kitchen of the cafeteria.393© ISLSFirst, the QR codes were placed at specific points of interest that were tightly connected to the narrative (e.g., atthe university’s medical center, where the nurses recorded the symptoms of the affected students; at the universitycafeteria, where the cooks did not follow food safety rules; at a lecture hall, where a professor lectured aboutmicrobes, etc.). In this version, the path that students walked along was designed to fit the theme and the narrativestructure. Second, the places where the QR codes were activated, were also enriched with physical cues whichwere also aligned with the narrative (e.g., broken freezer, kitchen disposable gloves, printed posters and diagrams,symptom notebook, fermented food whose production uses microbes such as beer, yogurt, etc.). Such designs ofthe strongly-coupled activity have been argued to support strong blending between the narrative and the physicalspace by creating “natural coincidences” between events in the virtual and the physical world (Reid et al., 2005b).The loosely-coupled AR activityThe loosely-coupled version of the activity took place at the same location (at the university premises) where thenarrative unfolded (Figures 3 and 4).Figure 3. Students participating in the looselycoupled activity at a QR code.Figure 4. Students participating in the looselycoupled activity collecting data from their tablet.In this way, the location induced the same ambience (e.g., same building, physical conditions) as the narrativeplot. However, there were no further relations between the AR activity narrative and the physical place. The QRcodes were placed randomly within the building and were not meaningfully related to the narrative. In addition,the location was not enriched with any physical cues or real objects. As a result, the relation of the narrative tothe location was weaker, which according to Rossito et al. (2016) could allow students to imagine their ownconnections between the story and the physical space.Data collection and analysisThis study employed a mixed methods approach. The collected data included baseline data, questionnairesinvestigating students’ immersion and learning gains, as well as post-activity interviews with 14 students fromCondition1 (63.6%) and 14 students from Condition2 (60.9%).Baseline dataWe collected baseline data using a survey, aiming at creating a profile for the students and establishing theequivalency of the two conditions. The survey had two main parts: Interest in science and Students’ attitudestowards tablets. Interest in science was measured using a Likert scale with 10 items derived from the Test ofScience-Related Attitudes (Fraser, 1981), as this was adapted and validated in the study of Bressler and Bodzin(2013). The Cronbach’s a for the adapted instrument was 0.90. Students’ attitudes towards tablets was assessedusing the Computer Attitude Measure for Young Students (CAMYS, Teo & Noyes, 2008), which was composedof 12 items, using a five-point Likert scale. The CAMYS is considered a valid instrument and has a documentedreliability alpha coefficient of .85. Differences between the two conditions were examined using the MannWhitney U test, given the small sample size of each condition and the lack of normal distribution in the data.Immersion and conceptual gains questionnairesAfter the implementation of the “Mysterious disease” AR activity, the students in each condition completed theAugmented Reality Immersion (ARI) questionnaire (Georgiou & Kyza, 2017b), which measured their experiencedimmersion, and a conceptual assessment test to investigate learning gains. First, the students were asked tocomplete the Total Immersion scale, which is comprised of two subscales with a total of seven items: Flow (3items) and Presence (4 items). The Cronbach’s α for the Τotal Ιmmersion scale has a documented reliability alphaICLS 2018 Proceedings394© ISLScoefficient of 0.82, while the Cronbach’s α for the Flow and the Presence subscales are .87 and .80correspondingly. Second, a conceptual understanding test was administered to assess the differences in students’conceptual learning about the scientific concepts related to topic of the AR investigation. The conceptualunderstanding test was composed of ten multiple-choice items and five open-ended questions. The aim of themultiple-choice items was to evaluate students’ factual knowledge, while the aim of the open-ended questionswas to evaluate students’ reasoning about microbes and the transmission of pathogens. A Mann-Whitney U testwas used to investigate the differences between the two conditions, given the small sample size of each conditionand the lack of normal distribution in the data.Post-activity interviewsFourteen students from each condition participated in semi-structured individual interviews, which took placeafter the intervention. The average time of the interviews was 19:09mins (SD=4:34mins). Students were initiallyasked to report feelings associated with their experience during the immersive AR activity, and then were probedto discuss feelings of presence (e.g., To what extent did you experience this problem-based investigation as afictional case? Did you perceive the narrative-based storyline as a real one or not?), their feelings of flow (e.g.,How focused did you feel during the problem-based investigation? To what degree did this investigation manageto capture all of your senses?), as well as the factors which had affected these feelings positively or negatively(e.g., What were the main factors affecting your feelings? How did these factors affect your feelings?).All interviews were transcribed and qualitatively analyzed using a thematic analysis approach (AttrideStirling, 2001), to investigate the factors students reported as affecting their feelings of presence and flow. Thisanalysis led to the identification of basic thematic categories, and factors discussed within each thematic categorywhich were hypothesized to influence the feelings of presence and flow during the AR activity in each condition.Each unique factor was counted once for each student (absence/presence) and was coded as negative or positive,thus providing a more nuanced indication of how each factor affected students’ immersion.FindingsSetting the baselineA Mann-Whitney U test was used to identify any potential differences between students in the two conditions, interms of their prior interest toward learning science and attitudes towards tablets use. As shown in Table 1, therewere no statistical differences between the students in both conditions.Table 1: Baseline assessment of students’ interest in science and attitudes towards tablets in each conditionInterest in ScienceAttitudes towards tabletsNote. *p≤.05, **p≤.01. ***p≤.001Condition 1Strongly-coupled ARMeanSD3.900.884.470.57Condition 2Loosely-coupled ARMeanSD3.481.024.51.44Z-1.52-0.69Total immersion: Experienced feelings of presence and flowA Mann-Whitney U test indicated statically significant differences in students’ total immersion in both conditions,after the intervention (Table 2).

The factors identified as affecting students’ sense of presence were classified in twodifferent basic themes: (a) Realism, expressing the extent of the activity’s fidelity for the students, and (b) Agency,expressing students’ perceived sense of control and volitional involvement in the activity. These factors arepresented in Table 4 and discussed in the following subsections in relation to the two students’ conditions.Table 4: Categorization of factors reported as affecting feelings of flow and presence in each conditionOrganizing themes1.

The mostICLS 2018 Proceedings396© ISLSfrequently reported factor was the problem-solving process, which was equally present and positively evaluatedin both conditions. As students mentioned, the problem-solving process increased their focus and attention. E.g.I was focused during the activity… As we had to look for evidence, organize them, and then findout the answer. (I was concentrated) as we had to reach a conclusion. From all the availabledata, we had to reach an outcome. From the first, second, third… From all the data anyway.From all the data you should find a basic… You should combine everything.[#13, Girl, Loosely-coupled activity]Also, in most of the cases students in both conditions emphasized how the narrative plot captured their focus. E.g.At the beginning, we felt anxiety. What will we find out? ... What is the case about?... Andbecause of the continuous action you feel impatient, to see what is going on until the end.[#24, Girl, Strongly-coupled activity]Level of challengeStudents in both conditions suggested that their feelings of flow depended on their perceived level of challenge.Students discussed two factors defining the level of difficulty they had experienced: (a) the problem-solvingprocess, (d) the integration of artifacts and real props (only mentioned in the case of the strongly-coupled activity),as in two cases students reported that they had difficulty to understand how the artifacts and real props wererelated with the case that they had to investigate as well as with the rest of the data that they had already collected.The most positively and negatively evaluated factor in both conditions was the problem-solving process.According to the positive evaluations, the level of the problem-solving was challenging but yet satisfactory. E.g.It was difficult but interesting. It was complicated… It was difficult as you had to had to gathermany data. During the activity, time flew. It was really nice.”[#2, Boy, Loosely-coupled activity]In contrast, according to the negative evaluations, the problem-solving process seemed very easy or very difficultfor other students. E.g.We were investigating the case…. However, the solution was obvious… It was all about foodpoisoning. We had no purpose to search anymore for something that was already obvious.[#26, Girl, Strongly-coupled activity]RealismStudents reported that their feelings of presence depended on the perceived level of realism of the activity.Students in both conditions discussed four factors as positively or negatively contributing to the realism of theactivity: (a) the augmentation of reality, (b) the video-based characters, which were activated at each QR code,(c) the multimedia material (e.g., videos, photos, etc.) which were provided during the activity, and (d) thenarrative plot. The most positively evaluated factor by students in both conditions was the narrative plot whichprovided an authentic case for investigation. E.g.Generally, it was quite a true story. For instance, it was not about a dragon, which killed thestudents and then disappeared. It was not very fictional. It was making sense.[#16, Boy, Strongly-coupled activity]A difference between the conditions was that realism was reported as more increased for the students whoparticipated in the strongly-coupled activity due to two additional factors: (a) the artifacts and the real props, aswell as (b) the QR codes’ purposeful placement in the physical space. According to the students, the artifacts andreal props allowed the collection of “realistic” evidence and made the investigation more “alive”. E.g.When we found the notepad, I was carried away as it did not seem as something fake. […] Ithought that it was real, as there were also (handwritten) notes inside.[#20, Boy, Strongly-coupled activity]Students also reported that the QR codes’ purposeful placement in the physical space allowed a more heightenedrelation between the narrative plot and the real space. E.g.ICLS 2018 Proceedings397© ISLSFor instance, when we visited the cafeteria, it was a real cafeteria! It was not something that Iwould have just seen through the tablet.[#25, Boy, Strongly-coupled activity]Both of these factors, which emerged as positive factors only in the case of the strongly-coupled activity, appearedto be also as the most influencing ones for students’ experienced sense of presence.AgencyStudents reported that their feelings of presence also depended on their perceived level of agency. Students inboth conditions discussed three main factors as positively and negatively contributing to their sense of agency:(a) the problem-solving process, (b) the narrative plot, and (c) the artifacts and real props. According to studentsin both conditions, the narrative plot positively contributed to their sense of agency as they felt a personalinvolvement with the case. E.g.It was really nice. It felt like that you were “inside”, as you were making the activity. [...] It feltlike you were a detective and you were looking to find the truth that was hidden in the mystery.[#10, Girl, Loosely-coupled activity]However, an emerging difference between the conditions was that the sense of agency was more heightened forthe students who employed the strongly-coupled activity, due to the artifacts and real props, which allowedstudents to interact with “realistic” evidence and collect data through a more interactive process. E.g.It was different, because in the tablet there were only some images. However, when there wereprops it was different. You could hold the evidence, you could see it, you could study it better…[#24, Girl, Strongly-coupled activity]In contrast, the lack of artifacts and real props was a negatively evaluated factor for the students who participatedin the loosely-coupled activity. Some of these students suggested the integration of real props which could providemore interactivity to the investigation process, even though they were not prompted on this topic. E.g.There were no real clues, we were just scanning the QR codes with the tablet. [...] I wouldprefer the QR codes to be smaller or even hidden to search for them… as well as to provide uswith real clues as evidence, and not only the website-based ones.[#8, Boy, Loosely-coupled activity]Overall, the use of artifacts and real props emerged as the most positively influencing factor for the condition withthe strongly-coupled version of the AR activity, while their absence emerged as the most negatively influencingfactor for the condition with the loosely-coupled version of the activity.Discussion and implicationsThe present study sought to investigate the hypothesis that the greatest the coupling between the physical spaceand the narrative of an AR activity is, the greater will students’ immersion and subsequent learning be. In thiscontext, we purposefully compared two conditions; Students in Condition1 participated in an AR activity withstrong coupling between its narrative and the physical space, while students in Condition2 participated in aloosely-coupled version of the activity.The findings from the analysis of the data from the two conditions indicated several differences. Studentswho participated in the strongly-coupled version of the AR activity had no statistically significant difference intheir experienced flow when compared to the students who participated in the loosely-coupled version of theactivity. However, students in the strongly-coupled version outperformed their counterparts, in terms of theexperienced sense of presence. This finding is aligned with the study of Reid et al. (2005), who argued thatpresence is increased when the virtual world of the activity matches with some artifact of the surrounding physicalenvironment. In contrast, this result contradicts the position of Rossito et al. (2016), who argued in favour ofloosely-coupled AR activities.The analysis of students’ post-activity interviews shed light to our findings in terms of the experiencedsense of flow and presence between the two conditions. In particular, the integration of real props as well as thepurposeful placement of the QR codes in the physical space did not seem to affect students’ focus as well as theirperceived level of challenge; as such, this could explain the lack of statistical difference between the experiencedflow among both conditions. On the other hand, the integration of real props as well as the QR codes’ purposefulICLS 2018 Proceedings398© ISLSplacement in the physical space had a significant positive impact on students’ perceived realism, as well as ontheir perceived sense of agency, which appeared as the most positively influencing factors for presence. As such,this could explain why the students who participated at the strongly-coupled version of the activity outperformedtheir counterparts, in terms of their experienced feelings of presence. These findings are aligned with priorarguments claiming that place-dependent learning experiences, such as those provided by strongly-couplededucational AR activities, may provide a “narrative” hook as well as an increased sense of agency or sense ofcontrol during the activity (Squire et al., 2007). In contrast, a place-independent educational AR activity, eventhough increasing the portability of the activity, may decrease the amount of authentic interaction with theenvironment (Klopfer & Sheldon, 2010). Our findings provide empirical support, while they also extend thesearguments, as we have found that a strongly-coupled activity can heighten the feelings of presence.The differences between students’ learning in the two conditions could be attributed to the differences instudents’ perceived immersion. According to our findings, the students who employed the strongly-coupledversion of the AR activity and experienced higher levels of presence also had higher learning gains, as they wereable to explain their reasoning better. These findings provide empirical support for Cheng and Tsai’s (2013)assumption that “perceptions of presence are expected to relate to learners’ behaviors in AR-related learning” (p.459), thus defining also their subsequent learning gains. Aiming to investigate this argument further, our futurework will analyze the learning process of the students who participated in each condition. A better understandingof how learning occurs in informal AR learning contexts can support the creation of hybrid spaces for learning,and the development of more immersive and effective AR learning environments.ReferencesAttride-Stirling, J.
