Agentic Trajectories: Development and Learning in a ProjectBased High School for Marginalized StudentsVanessa Svihla, University of New Mexico, vsvihla@unm.eduLiza Kittinger, University of New Mexico, lkittinger@unm.eduAbstract: Traditional approaches to schooling can marginalize already vulnerable students,preventing them from learning; we explore how agency might play a role in supporting suchstudents to develop as learners in a project-based high school that employs design pedagogy.We first examine whether agency can explain variance in standardized mathematics scores.Regression analysis indicates home language and agency had a significant effect onmathematics scores. We then turn to data collected through extended participant observation tocharacterize decisions students make. Based on these, we detail a developmental agencytrajectory: dis/engagement agency serves as a covert means for students to learn; makerlyagency serves as an entry point for students to explore and develop interests, and designerlyagency allows students to take ownership of design problems and learn as they do so.Major issues addressed and significanceThe value of students having agency—opportunities to make and carry out decisions about how and what they arelearning—is contested in research; some view agency leading to increased learning (Pellegrino, 2004), whileothers critique this stance (Schwartz & Okita). Students from high socio-economic groups are likelier to receiveexperiential, high-agency approaches to instruction, creating opportunity gaps (Milner, 2012) that reproduce andfurther widen existing achievement gaps. We investigate whether high agency in a design-based school that servesmarginalized students relates to achievement. We characterize the types of decisions students make and considerhow such decisions create developmental trajectories for these students. We were guided by research questions:(1) Do demographic variables, attendance, and measures of agency explain variance in standardized mathematicsscores? (2) What kinds of agency do students have at a project-based school that serves students marginalized bytraditional schooling? How might these create or lead to learning opportunities?Theoretical approachWe define agency as making decisions, and focus on decision that affect learning. Agency is socially-constructed(Ahearn, 2001); decisions and actions are constrained or afforded by social structures, which in turn are shapedand reshaped by decisions and actions (Bourdieu, 1977). Thus, agency “progressively emerges out of interactionsbetween participants and their activities” (Damşa, Kirschner, Andriessen, Erkens, & Sins, 2010, p. 115). Agencydepends on the opportunity structure (Narayan & Petesch, 2007), which can be thought of by considering whetherthere are opportunities to make decisions, whether students actually make decisions, and whether they are satisfiedwith the outcomes (Alsop, Bertelsen, & Holland, 2006). In a project-based learning setting, the locus of control isshifted more to the students than it is in traditional settings (Brown & Campione, 1994). In project-based settingsthat employ design pedagogy, even more control may be granted to the learners; designers occupy an agentiveposition. Design pedagogy positions students as designers working on authentic problems for actual clients andcustomers (Edwards-Vandenhoek & Sandbach, 2014).Methodological approachThe participants were students enrolled in an urban, not-for-profit charter school in the American Southwest. Theschool aims to have high impact by serving students who have been marginalized by traditional schooling. Theoriginal sample included 522 students (every student enrolled during a one-year period). The school population ishighly mobile. We selected students who had complete data for all measures, which resulted in a sample of 44students (~one third of the students enrolled/attending regularly during data collection). The participants werepredominantly male (n=30). Thirty-eight identified as Latino/a, four as White, and two as American Indian.Thirty-two students reported speaking English and twelve reported speaking Spanish at home. The meanattendance rate for Trimester 2 was 93% (SD=9.16%).A survey with 5-point Likert items adapted from Alsop et al. (2006) was given at the beginning of thetrimester (n= 105). Discovery Education (DE) assessments (n= 114) were given in the middle of the trimester.Qualitative data were collected through participant observation, resulting in ~1000 pages of field notes, and ~400hours of audio/video records, organized into a searchable database.ICLS 2016 Proceedings946© ISLSWe modeled variance in DE math scores as a linear combination of attendance, home language, and twoagency variables: (1) I have had opportunities to make decisions related to this project. (M=3.43, SD=1.02); (2)When I made a decision related to this project, I was happy with the result. (M=3.77, SD=.77). We conductedinteraction analysis (Jordan & Henderson, 1995), beginning with a general analytic focus—agency, identifyingparticular moments of agency situated in and reflective of the school practices. We grouped these into three typesand share representative vignettes for each.FindingsRegression modelingWe modeled DE mathematics scores (M=1573, SD=74). In model 1 (Table 1), a multiple linear regression wascalculated to predict DE mathematics scores based on attendance and home language and was significant, (F(2,41)= 4.42, p<.05). Speaking English in the home predicted higher DE mathematics scores, but attendance was notsignificant. In model 2, we added reported agency, and this was significant, (F(3, 40)= 5.12, p<.05). Students whoreported higher levels of agency tended to have higher DE mathematics scores. In model 3, a multiple linearregression was calculated to predict DE mathematics scores based on attendance, home language and satisfactionwith the decisions they had made; this was significant (F(3, 40)= 3.46, p<.05), but reported satisfaction withdecisions was not.Table 1.

Some students exhibited relatively traditional indicators of being engaged. Benjamin, for instance,interjected questions as they occurred to him when a guest speaker presented. However, detecting whether astudent has decided to engage with particular content can be difficult. For instance, we consider observations ofIvan, a member of a clique of young men who appeared to systematically disengage. On some occasions, theyappeared quietly disengaged, staring at their smartphones. While we observed them using their smartphones tosocialize, we also observed that staring at one’s smartphone can sometimes be a means to listen. It can signal toone’s peers, “leave me alone, I am busy” and creates a stance of disengagement that is comfortable for many ofthese students to wear.ICLS 2016 Proceedings947© ISLS2015/01/30 field notes: 11:01am: A video of interviews with people who are homeless isplaying. Some students take notes, some don’t have notebooks out. Ivan stares at his phone. Astudent on the other side of the partition continues to play music on his phone, which is audibleand increases in volume, making it somewhat hard to hear the video. At 11:08 Ivan asks Mr. Fto “get the music turned off.”We see this as evidence of Ivan’s dis/engagement agency. We infer that he made this request because he wantedto be able to hear the video that was playing, and not that he simply disliked the music, as the music had beenplaying prior to the video. Near the end of the project, (2015/03/10) the teachers discussed poverty andhomelessness. Ivan was staring at his phone during the beginning of this exchange. Mr. F asked:Mr. F:Benjamin:Mr. F:Ivan:What is poverty? How ‘bout that. Who knows what poverty is. Look it upon your phone.Ask the GoogleAsk the Google. Ivan’s on it. Tell me what poverty is. Look it up.Poverty is—poverty is where you can be living in a house, but you are onsuch low income, if not—if any income—you're almost a bum in a house.We see this exchange as suggesting that Ivan had been attending to the conversation, and further, that Mr. F wasaware of this. We do not argue that staring at one’s phone should be viewed as evidence that a student is listening,or that Ivan’s attention was fully on listening; rather, we argue that when students have developed identities asfailures and troublemakers in response to traditional schooling, they may seek covert ways to engage, particularlywhen the material is meaningful to them. As another student, Raoul explained to us, “People think we aren’tlistening, Miss, but we are.” Mr. F confirmed that he believed students choose to listen covertly, and that he takesadvantage of this as a way to draw students into more active participation.We define makerly agency as students making decisions about the process and form of the things theyare making. Viewed from a constructionist lens, the things students make should be meaningful and publicallysharable. While the things they make are shared at exhibitions, the making can be rather mechanical at times. Weobserved instances of this, where students used hot glue guns and cardboard to assemble something in a routine,mechanical fashion. Much more commonly, however, we observed a makerly stance, with much tinkering andtesting. For instance, in one project, students were asked to make models of Cal-Earth Ecodomes by filling longskinny balloons with sand. They quickly discovered getting sand into the balloons was difficult, and began makingtools to assist them in this task. The tools began as paper funnels, but quickly developed. Ivan and his friends dugthrough trash bins for straws and water bottles and combined these in various ways, resulting in some of the mostsophisticated tools. While we don’t argue that this activity directly supported content learning, more studentschose to participate than we had observed up to this point, in this project.We define designerly agency as the choices students make to frame the problem they are solving.Designerly agency more directly relates to learning. We share vignettes of how Mr. F explained problem framing,and how two senior students differently framed the problem.Mr. J:Benjamin:Mr. J:Benjamin:So what we're gonna do right now as a group, is define our problem, alright.We kinda know the whole purpose of what we're trying to do here, but Iwant everybody to be on the same page, and I could tell you what theproblem is, but that doesn’t include you guys and more importantly itdoesn’t give you guys the opportunity to contribute and say, ‘No, I think thisis the problem,’ or ‘I think we should word it that way.’ So what we need todo, as a group, here, is collaboratively come up with a specific problem thatwe are trying to address by building these homeless shelters. So someonestart shouting something out. What’s the problem that we are trying to fixright now? What are we trying to solve?I'm just guessing here, but homelessness.Homelessness. Alright. So are we trying to solve homelessness, in general?No, we're trying to help them.A couple weeks later, Mr. F asked Andre to describe the project to a new student. Benjamin joined in.ICLS 2016 Proceedings948© ISLSBenjamin:Andre:Benjamin:Andre:Benjamin:This project's basically oriented around homeless people and how, howwe're gonna help them, and, uh, right now, um, we've just been—we went toa—an interview with them and talked to him and got to know him, a bit ofunderstanding, a bit of what—how their everyday life is.What's their needs and stuff, I mean////What's their needs.The project's name is actually called Waste Land II, so we are, we, um, wealso rely on, also, the—what's available to them on the streets, to give ‘emideas of what to make shelters of to stay warm, stay safe at night. […]It's most definitely a interesting project and we, we're all —we are gonnahelp someone, so we’re trying to do this, so. It's interesting.We see both students expressing interest in the project. Benjamin framed the problem generally—helpingpeople who are homeless, and Andre framed the problem specifically—designing temporary shelters from foundmaterials. These framings led them to make different choices about what information to seek.Conclusions, discussion, and implicationsWe found students who speak English at home and who reported higher levels of agency scored higher on astandardized math assessment. It is promising that students making decisions, even ones they are not happy with,can predict higher math achievement. Qualitative analysis afforded an opportunity to detail the kinds of agencyendemic to this school. While the set is not intended to be exhaustive, we see it as useful for learning scientists asthey go about viewing data from less affluent and privileged settings. We do not argue the set generalizes broadly,but rather, that “attending to both learning and development through a cultural lens” (Lee, Spencer, & Harpalani,2003, p. 6) is particularly important for learning scientists working with marginalized students; it is easy to missindicators of engagement that fall outside our worldviews. We found traditional markers of engagement can maskthe ways students choose to engage in content delivery, decisions students make about making can serve as a pointof entry for learning, and decisions students make about designing can provide meaningful, extended learningopportunities.ReferencesAhearn, L.
