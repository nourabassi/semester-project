Videocase Complexity and Preservice Teacher Noticing: Examiningthe Effects of Cognitive LoadAlison Castro Superfine, University of Illinois at Chicago, amcastro@uic.eduJohn Bragelman, University of Illinois at Chicago, jbrage2@uic.eduAbstract: Despite the growing research base on preservice teacher noticing of children’smathematical thinking with video, few studies consider the complex nature of the videorepresentations. Borrowing from cognitive load theory, we coded the complexity of the salientteaching and learning events captured in video and analyzed the relationship between videocomplexity and PST noticing. Results indicate that videos with higher intrinsic load increaseopportunities for noticing, and videos with higher extraneous load negatively affect noticing.Over the past decade, the use of video to support teacher learning has grown considerably in the field of teachereducation (Brophy, 2008). Researchers utilized the construct of teacher noticing to understand what and howteachers learn from video (cf. Sherin, Jacobs, & Philipp, 2011). Research on preservice teachers’ (PST) noticingin video has demonstrated positive impacts on PSTs’ ability to attend to and interpret children’s mathematicalthinking (CMT). As learning from representations of teaching is dependent on the nature of the representations,we shift the focus of research on PST noticing from what PSTs notice in video to how video representationcomplexity impacts PST noticing. We focus on the following research question: (1) How does complexity of avideo representation impact PSTs’ attending to and interpreting of CMT?FramingFollowing Jacobs and her colleagues, we operationalize PST noticing as attending to and interpreting CMT. Ourprior research suggested that the use of videocases to support PSTs’ ability to notice CMT, in particular, seemedineffective, particularly as not all video representations are created equal, which has considerable implications forPST noticing in video. Incorporating video clips that are more or less complex in terms of the nature of theteaching and learning events portrayed is particularly important for novices who often struggle to pay attention toCMT in video (Jacobs et al., 2010). Video is a type of representation of complex teaching and learning practices,which highlights the salient events and at the same time masks other events related to the represented events. Wedefine this simultaneous highlighting and masking as video complexity.Borrowing from cognitive load theory, we developed a rubric for analyzing the complexity of the salientteaching and learning events captured in video clips. Cognitive load theory distinguishes between three types ofload: intrinsic load, extraneous load, and germane load (Sweller, 2003). Drawing on cognitive load research(Sweller, 2003) and teacher noticing research (Jacobs et al., 2010), we coded complexity under two dimensions.The intrinsic load dimension included Depth of Enacted Task, Clarity of Student Thinking, Teacher Participation,Sequential Moments of CMT, Simultaneous Moments of CMT, and Types of CMT. The extraneous loaddimension Non-CMT Moments and Visual-Verbal Noise.AnalysisTwo coders followed a 2-stage coding scheme. The first stage assessed whether a PST’s response described whatthe children were doing or saying about mathematics. The second stage of coding explored the degree of evidence(i.e., none, limited, robust) for attending to and interpreting CMT in the PST’s response. Two coders were assignedto each videocase, and there was greater than 90% reliability in both rounds of coding. Then, using the videocomplexity rubric, two coders scored each videocase as low or high on the load-noticing categories and reconcileddiscrepancies. Seven total videos were scored, ultimately reaching 100% agreement. Data for this analysis comesfrom 233 PSTs over two semesters of required math courses from an elementary teacher education program at anurban university in a large, Midwestern city in the United States. PSTs were assigned to view videocases forhomework during a semester. The data presented unique constraints for the analysis, and so we utilizedgeneralized estimating equations (GEE) for the analysis as it allows for repeated measures analysis (Zeger &Liang, 1986), a working, autoregressive correlation matrix that adjusts for within-observation correlations(Fitzmaurice, Laird, & Rotnitzky, 1993), and an ordinal outcome variable with missing data (Kenward, Lesaffre,& Molenberghs, 1994).Results and discussionICLS 2018 Proceedings1567© ISLSSPSS was used for the analysis with level of noticing as the outcome variable and cognitive load criteria as theindependent factors. Scaffold level and videocase ID were used as within-subject variables. Two redundantcovariate, Sequential Moments and Visual-Verbal Noise, and two non-significant variables, Clarity of StudentThinking and Types of Moments, were removed for the second model with results in Table 4. Four cognitive loadcriteria from our rubric significantly predict the population of PSTs level of attending: Depth of Enacted Task,Teacher Participation, Simultaneous Moments of CMT, and Non-Moments of CMT.Table 4: Parameter estimates, standard errors (SE), Wald statistics (χ2,degrees of freedom), correspondingsignificance probabilities (p), and log odds ratio from the analysesDepth of enacted task, significantly impacts PSTs’ level of attending (𝛽𝛽1 = .322, 𝜒𝜒 2 = 6.977, 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = 1, 𝑝𝑝 =.008). This outcome suggests a videocase with a high depth of enacted task resulted in a higher percentage ofPST responses that attended to CMT and discussed the strategy being implemented by the child(ren). In otherwords, a PST can attend to CMT with some degree of recognition of strategies if more opportunities are presentedto the PST. The intrinsic cognitive load criteria, teacher participation, significantly impacts PSTs’ level ofattending (β3 = .614, χ2 = 33.254, df = 1, p = .000). This outcome suggests the presence of a teacher in avideocase who asks questions to elicit CMT lowers the level of attending by the population of PSTs. In otherwords, PSTs seem to attend to CMT and attend with more interpretation when a teacher is not asking childrenquestions to elicit thinking. The intrinsic cognitive load criteria, simultaneous moments of CMT, significantlyimpacts PSTs’ level of attending (𝛽𝛽5 = .156, 𝜒𝜒 2 = 4.496, 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = 1, 𝑝𝑝 = .034). This outcome suggests, aligningwith the findings of the depth of enacted task dimension, the population of PSTs can attend to CMT at a higherlevel if more opportunities for attending to CMT are present, even when simultaneously presented in a videocase.The intrinsic cognitive load criteria, non-moments of CMT, significantly impacts PSTs’ level of attending (𝛽𝛽7 =−.527, 𝜒𝜒 2 = 43.339, 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = 1, 𝑝𝑝 = .000). This finding suggests non-moments of CMT in videocases presentadditional, extraneous cognitive load on the population of PSTs and reduces the level of attending to CMT by thepopulation of PSTs.In addition, two of our hypothetical cognitive load criteria, clarity of student thinking and type of CMT,did not significantly impact the population of PSTs’ noticing of CMT as hypothesized. While no conclusions canbe drawn, this suggests further research is necessary, particularly on the relevance of clarity of student thinkingdue to its prevalence in noticing research. In sum, as research on PST noticing continues to evolve, researchersshould consider the nature of the video representations used in their work, and the relationship between what PSTsare attending to and how they are interpreting the captured events.ReferencesBrophy, J.
