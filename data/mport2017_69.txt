Prior researchsuggests that both network-driven selection patterns (reciprocity and transitivity) and theactive selection of specific others are important. Selecting appropriate collaboration partnersmay moreover require what we call cognitive group awareness, (i.e. knowledge about theknowledge of others). In a field study at two multi-disciplinary scientific events (AlpineRendez-Vous 2011 and 2013) including N= 287 researchers, we investigated selectionpatterns, looking specifically at career level and disciplinary background, and included acognitive group awareness intervention. While we could not completely explain howresearchers choose with whom they interact, we found that transitivity and interactionduration are relevant for later collaboration. Cognitive group awareness support was beneficialfor fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. Career level was a less relevant factor. Wediscuss measures for supporting newcomer integration and community buildings based on ourfindings.Collaboration and integration of newcomers in scientific communitiesCommunities must constantly integrate new members to stay active and to further develop and cope withchanging demands. Scientific communities can be considered to be a special form of communities of practice(Kienle & Wessner, 2006). According to Kienle and Wessner (2005), scientific communities consist ofheterogeneous, often interdisciplinary groups of members who are usually geographically distributed. Membersof scientific communities also sometimes have backgrounds in different disciplines and scientific cultures,resulting in the use of different methods and theories. What brings them together is a joint field of researchinterests. Therefore, scientific communities benefit from the integration of new members and their knowledgeand ideas. In interdisciplinary scientific communities in particular, successful collaboration among thecommunity members is another important factor for community cohesion and development. Successfulinterdisciplinary collaboration in a scientific community requires an integration of the contributing disciplineson some level, for example the mutual integration of concepts, theories, methodologies, and epistemologicalprinciples (van den Besselaar & Heimeriks, 2001). The development of mutual understanding and the buildingof shared representations are important for fruitful communication between experts of multiple domains(Fischer, 2000).Yet many scientific communities struggle in integrating newcomers and developing interdisciplinarycollaborations (see for example Kienle & Wessner, 2006, about challenges of the CSCL community) and it isunclear how to improve the situation. The huge body of research on scientific communities is so far mostlybased on bibliometric analyses focusing on co-authorship or citation analysis of conference proceedings orjournal papers (e.g. Lee, Ye, & Recker, 2012). The publication of articles is affected by many factors andbibliometric analyses so far were not able to identify factors that influence the integration of newcomers. Ratherthan looking at the results of successful collaborations (i.e. joint publications or references to each other’swork), it seems necessary to study the onset of collaborations where newcomers have a chance to be included.Face-to-face meetings in conferences and workshops may provide regular opportunities for newcomers to startcollaborations and thereby to become integrated into the scientific community (Kienle & Wessner, 2005).Potential selection patterns and influential factors on selection processes inscientific communitiesTo understand the behavior of researchers at scientific events, we should take into account that humaninteraction in face-to-face settings is based on several robust characteristics (e.g. physical and digital proximity,CSCL 2017 Proceedings519© ISLSsocial support, and community belonging) although there are differences based on the context in whichinteraction takes place (Isella et al., 2011). Research on interactional linguistics clearly illustrates how humaninteraction is co-constructed by phenomena such as gaze, prosody of language, gestures and general bodymovement (e.g. Goodwin, 2000) and this co-construction is viewed by many as a collaboration at the microlevel of communication; it is where any long-term collaboration begins.Sociological and social network research suggests, furthermore, that the selection of partners for longterm relationships follows several patterns. Selection patterns have been studied in various contexts and theliterature provides a variety of observed patterns. Some selection patterns are based on the opportunitiesprovided by the given social network structure surrounding the selecting person, while others focus on personalpreferences for specific persons. Reciprocity and transitivity as network-driven patterns and homophily as aperson-driven pattern can be described as the three most important selection patterns (Baerveldt, van de Bunt, &de Federico de la Rua, 2010). We will briefly describe them and discuss how they may be relevant for selectionprocesses in scientific communities. Note that network-driven patterns and homophily effects are not mutuallyexclusive but can co-exist (Aiello, Barrat, Cattuto, Ruffo, & Schifanella).Reciprocity and transitivityNetwork-driven selection patterns assume that the way in which persons choose relations is influenced by the(local) structure of their social network, and in particular that the alters chosen to establish a relation arepreferentially chosen among those easily accessible in this network. Reciprocity is one of the simplest suchselection patterns: If there is already a connection between two individuals, in which person A has chosenperson B, for example as a friend or as someone to ask for advice, while person B does not yet perceive personA likewise, it is very likely that they will balance their relationship in the future. This can either mean thatperson B also chooses person A or that their relation will dissolve so that reciprocity is reached.Transitivity is also a selection pattern driven by proximity in the network: Two individuals (A and B)who both are connected to a third person (C) are likely to build a relation as well. In social network terms, theyare building a “transitive triple” or “closing a triangle”. Reasons for such transitivity patterns are manifold, e.g.,person C can easily introduce A and B or A and B may share a common interest or activity which was the initialreason for their connection with C. C might also be interested in setting up a connection between A and B tostabilize the relation to both (Baerveldt et al., 2010).Selecting specific othersSocial capital theory is one of the major approaches that explains person-driven selection patterns (Baerveldt etal., 2010). According to social capital theory (Coleman, 1988; Lin, 2001), people rationally select to engagewith others either to maintain their own resources or to get access to resources of others. In the context of ascientific community, a vital resource accessible through social capital is, for instance, information about newdevelopments in the field (Coleman, 1988).The selection patterns for specific others can be categorized as homophilous or heterophilous.Homophily is a well observed, and probably the oldest and widest studied selection pattern (Baerveldt et al.,2010). Homophily is the tendency of people to be in contact with others who are similar to them (McPherson,Smith-Lovin, & Cook, 2001). Similarity/dissimilarity patterns influencing the selection of contact partners havebeen studied in regard to very different aspects, such as gender, religion, age, education, occupation and socialclass, behavior, attitudes, beliefs, abilities and aspirations (McPherson et al., 2001).According to social capital theory, the selection of specific others is based on the maintenance or gainof resources. Maintaining resources is assumed to be the more dominant motive and leads to expressive actionstowards others, meaning that people approach others to claim recognition for their resources or aim at receivingsentiments related to the maintenance of these resources (Lin, 2001). In a scientific community, such actionscould include statements to gain recognition for one’s own expertise on a topic or sharing feelings about thecomplicated nature of a certain type of data collection. Such expressive actions require the least effort and bearthe lowest risks among peers with similar resources and status, explaining why homophilous selections ofinteraction partners are most common (Lin, 2001). Researchers from other theoretical perspectives have alsoprovided explanations for the generally observed tendency for homophilous selection patterns, e.g. from areinforcement perspective, similar others may be more likely to reinforce behavior they show themselves andpersons who reward us are preferred (Byrne & Clore, 1970.Information about othersPerceiving others as similar or dissimilar is likely to be influenced by which information about them isaccessible. Some information is usually easily visible, such as gender or ethnicity, while other information isCSCL 2017 Proceedings520© ISLSinvisible and harder to access (Baerveldt et al., 2010). Invisible information, such as expertise and knowledge ofa person, are especially relevant for collaboration and collaborative learning (Cannon-Bowers & Salas, 2001;Wegner, 1987) as they can, for example, simplify grounding processes.To select appropriate collaboration partners and interact meaningfully with them, knowledge abouttheir knowledge seems to be necessary, i.e. it may require cognitive group awareness (Janssen & Bodemer,2013). To select collaboration partners in a scientific community, relevant information about other researchersmay include their area of expertise, research interest, and knowledge (their personal resources), as well as theirprofessional network and access to other experts (their social resources) (Lin, 2001).Newcomers usually have only little knowledge about a new community and need to acquire it tobecome able to contribute more and in a proper way (Levine & Moreland, 2013). Compared to monodisciplinary communities, this might be even more complicated in multi- and interdisciplinary communitiesbecause of the variety of research lines. Although knowledge about researchers seems easy to acquire as most ofthem present their bios and publications on their websites, it is probably hard for a newcomer to identify the‘important’ people in a community or those who could be relevant for their own research in face-to-facesettings. In friendship networks, students with little information about their peers are assumed to be less activein initiating new friendships. They seem also more likely to use rather passive selection strategies, such astransitivity (forming new friendships with friends of their friends), instead of initiating new friendships withpeers who might be a good fit to them regarding for example, norms and values (Baerveldt et al., 2010).Consequently, newcomers in scientific communities may be disadvantaged in finding new collaborationpartners as they may not only use less active strategies for initiating new collaborations with other researchersbut they can also benefit less from network-based selection patterns as they are not linked to many otherresearchers.Newcomers in scientific communities can be found at all career levels because researchers tend to beinvolved in several scientific communities at the same time and, therefore, are used to switching roles, oftenfrom expert in one scientific community to newcomer in another scientific community (Kienle & Wessner,2005). However, PhD students are the most common form of newcomers in scientific communities and they canbe expected to suffer from the most disadvantages in finding collaboration partners. In contrast to moreexperienced researchers, PhD students do not only lack group awareness in the new scientific community butalso lack knowledge on scientific collaboration in general. They are moreover often seen as having lessexpertise and being less available to collaborations not involving their supervisor and, therefore, as lessattractive collaboration partners for other researchers. Therefore, it seems promising to support PhD students atscientific events. Results from group awareness research in smaller groups suggest that enhancing groupawareness may also be a helpful means of support in scientific communities.Research questionSumming up the previous line of argumentation, it is an open question if certain types of members are moreadvantaged or disadvantaged in finding interaction and collaboration partners and to what extent the interactionand the initiation of collaborations at meetings of scientific communities follows similar patterns as thedevelopment of other forms of relationships. Assuming that PhD students are an especially relevant group ofnewcomers for scientific communities but disadvantaged in finding collaboration partners, a further question iswhether they can benefit from cognitive group awareness support. Finally, the connection between presentinteraction and later collaboration is still unclear. These research gaps lead to the following question:To what extent do career level, disciplinary background, and homophily regarding these two attributes,as well as group awareness support, reciprocity and transitivity predict the selection of face-to-face interactionpartners and collaboration partners?MethodStudy context and participantsThe study was conducted at the Alpine Rendez-Vous’ 2011 and 2013 in France, two scientific events that aimedat bringing together researchers from multiple disciplines working on technology-enhanced learning to fostercommunity building and scientific progress in the field.Both Alpine Rendez-Vous’ were structured in a similar way: each event consisted of severalworkshops on specific topics of technology-enhanced learning, and each workshop lasted one and a half days.Half of the workshops took place in the first part of the event, followed by a community event for all eventparticipants in the evening of the second day. The second group of workshops took place after the communityevent. Both Alpine Rendez-Vous’ were deliberately located in a large hotel at a remote place in the French AlpsCSCL 2017 Proceedings521© ISLSto avoid external influences and to provide many opportunities for networking among the participants. Almostall participants stayed in the same hotel.While each workshop had been selected in a competitive process and was organized independently, there was ageneral schedule for all workshops at the event to synchronize starting time, breaks, and end time. Between theworkshop time slots, all present participants had breakfast, lunch, dinner, and coffee breaks together, as well asa long afternoon break which allowed networking also across workshops in independent social activities.The Alpine Rendez-Vous 2011 consisted of four workshops in the first half and four workshops in thesecond half of the event. Additionally, a winter school for doctoral students was held across the whole event.However, winter school data will not be reported in the following analyses because of its unique design andcomposition compared to other workshops. The Alpine Rendez-Vous 2013 comprised five workshops in thefirst half and five workshops in the second half of the event. Altogether, 136 persons participated in workshopsat the Alpine Rendez-Vous 2011 and 151 individual persons participated in workshops at the Alpine RendezVous 2013, leading to a sample of N = 287 individual participants. The majority of the participants was fromEuropean countries.Study design, data collection, and instrumentsThe study had an experimental design in which the factor group awareness support (with vs. without) wasvaried across different workshops in a randomized way. Additional quasi-experimental variables career level(doctoral student vs. experienced researcher) and disciplinary background (Information Technology vs. SocialSciences) varied naturally among participants within the workshops.The data collection procedure was the same in both scientific events and for both experimentalcondition and control group: After being informed about their participation in a study and signing a form ofconsent during conference registration, participants were equipped with an RFID device, which immediatelystarted tracking their face-to-face proximity with other participants during the conference. Tracking wasdeactivated when participants checked out of the hotel and returned their RFID device. Additionally, a socialnetwork questionnaire was handed out to each participant at the end of each workshop. Participants who had toleave earlier were asked to fill in an online version of the questionnaire. Personal data about the participants(career level and disciplinary background) were collected together with the social network questionnaire andwithin the registration form for the event.Independent variablesGroup awareness supportIn the experimental condition, workshop participants received a brochure with information about otherworkshop participants. The brochure contained profiles of all workshop participants, which we compiled basedon information from participants’ personal websites. Each profile included basic information about each person(name, picture, and contact information), information about personal resources (research interests andexemplary publications), and information pointing to their social resources (affiliations and background). Wehanded the brochure to the participants at the beginning of the workshop without further instructions. Thecontrol group did not receive a brochure.Career level and disciplinary backgroundData on both career level and disciplinary background were extracted from a questionnaire. While threedifferent career levels were originally specified on the questionnaire (PhD/doctoral student, Early/Mid career(postdoc), and full professor), we collapsed the two latter categories. This resulted in a variable distinguishingonly between PhD/doctoral students and experienced researchers (Early/Mid career and full professors forminga unique category). This allowed us to include career level as a single dummy variable into the model and madethe results easier to interpret.Information about the disciplinary background of the participants was handled similarly, resulting in avariable separating researchers with a background in Information Technology from those with a background in asocial science (e.g. psychology, education, learning sciences etc.). This classification was chosen because theAlpine Rendez-Vous’ had the specific focus on bringing researchers from those two types of disciplinestogether and to foster their collaboration.Data sources and measures of dependent variablesCSCL 2017 Proceedings522© ISLSNumber of interaction partners and duration of interaction measured by RFID devices for trackingface-to-face proximityThe RFID devices, developed by the SocioPatterns collaboration (http://www.sociopatterns.org) were integratedinto the name badge of the participants. The devices engage in bidirectional low-power radio communication.As the human body acts as a shield for the used radio frequency, and as the badges are worn on the chest,badges can exchange radio packets only when the individuals wearing them face each other at close range(about 1 to 1.5 m). The measuring infrastructure captured close face-to-face proximity between two individualswith a temporal resolution of 20 seconds, and therefore gives access to the amount of time that two participantsspent together (see Cattuto et al., 2010) for a detailed description of the infrastructure). The RFID devices onlytracked face-to-face proximity within the range of antennas, which were located in public spaces of the hotelonly, so spare time activities taking place outside of the hotel were not tracked.In order to exclude noise and very brief, insignificant contacts, we considered only pairs of individualswith a total measured interaction time of at least 100 seconds during the total event. The set of pairs ofindividuals with such interactions gives us the interaction network of the event. For each participant, weextracted from this network his/her number of distinct interaction partners.Number of previous and potential new collaboration partners, measured by social networkquestionnairesSocial network questionnaires were individually adapted to each workshop and contained a list of all workshopparticipants’ names. Participants were asked to indicate with whom they had collaborated already before theevent and with whom they had found potential for future collaboration.We computed the number of previous collaboration partners and potential new collaboration partnersusing the social network questionnaire data. For each participant, we computed the number of previouscollaboration partners (‘Freeman degree’) as the number of participants in the workshop with whom theparticipant declared to have had collaborated before the workshop. Likewise, we summed up the number ofparticipants in the workshop with whom the participant had indicated to see potential for future collaborationand this yielded their number of potential new collaboration partners. As many of these include previouscollaboration partners, we also consider specifically within these potential future collaboration partners thepotential new collaboration partners (i.e., the ones who were not declared as previous partners).Reciprocity, transitivity, and homophilyReciprocity, transitivity, and homophily in the selection of interaction partners and potential new collaborationpartners were computed from both data sources using the analysis tool RSiena. The tool compares the expectednumber of reciprocal, transitive, and homophile interaction relations and new collaboration relations with theactual numbers (Ripley, Snijders, Boda, Vörös, & Preciado, 2014).AnalysesTwo different analysis methods were used: Linear mixed models were created using the R package lme4 version1.1 – 11 to predict each person’s number of interaction partners / potential new collaboration partners. For eachdependent variable, interactions and new collaborations, two models were computed. The first model wascomputed without interaction effects whereas the second model included interaction effects of career level,disciplinary background, and group awareness support. The models contained random effects for the differentworkshops and were run on the whole dataset, which included the data from both ARVs. To investigateselection patterns, we used the RSiena package version 1.1-232 in R for simulation investigation for empiricalnetwork analysis. We computed a model in which the development from the network of previous collaborationsto the network of potential future collaborations was predicted for each workshop. In a meta-analysis of theestimates in the individual workshop models, we calculated the overall estimate across 1) all workshops, 2) allworkshops without cognitive group awareness support, and 3) all workshops with cognitive group awarenesssupport.ResultsTable 1 gives an overview of four models aiming at explaining the participants’ number of interaction partnersduring the workshop and their number of potential new collaboration partners at the end of the workshop.Having previous collaboration partners lead to more interaction partners and more potential new collaborationpartners. Career level is not a significant predictor in any of the models. Disciplinary background, in contrast,predicts the number of potential new collaboration partners, showing that participants with a background inInformation Technology have less potential new collaboration partners at the end of the workshop. We do notCSCL 2017 Proceedings523© ISLSsee similar effects regarding the number of interaction partners. Moreover, group awareness support does notshow an influence on the number of interaction partners nor on the number of potential new collaborationpartners. No interaction effect of group awareness support with career level or disciplinary background isobserved. The models aimed at predicting the number of interaction partners do not fit well, as they actuallycreate more variance than a model with random effects only. The models explaining the number of potentialnew collaboration partners, in contrast, explain a large amount of variance.Table 1: Models for the number of interaction partner and for the number of potential new collaboration partnersFixed EffectsInterceptPrevious collaboration partnerscareer level (PhD student)Discipline (Information Technology)Group awareness supportNumber of interactionpartnersMain effectsInteractionmodeleffects modelEstimate (se) Estimate (se)4.497**(0.939)0.138*(0.061)0.571(0.486)0.348(0.505)0.965(1.344)4.695**(0.984)0.135*(0.061)0.415(0.680)0.005(0.769)0.611(1.449)0.256(0.952)0.577(1.024)9.006**(0.669)0.283**(0.082)-0.498(0.720)-1.778*(0.680)-0.387(0.831)9.3387.2159.4267.06921.6011.28421.7911.264-13%-10%73%74,2%Career level * group awareness support-Discipline * group awareness support-Random Effectsσ²τ00Model fitPseudo-R2 (variance between workshopsexplained)*p < .05; **p < .01Number of potential newcollaboration partnersMain effectsInteractionmodeleffects modelEstimate (se) Estimate (se)-9.196**(0.774)0.281**(0.083)-0.759(1.004)-2.044*(0.975)-0.757(1.130)0.484(1.421)0.481(1.375)We now look at the RSiena results that aimed at explaining how dyads that had not previouslycollaborated identified the potential for a new collaboration after the workshop and which factors are related tothis change. Table 2 shows the results of the meta-analyses across the workshops for the different predictors. Inthe overall model across all workshops, we find that both reciprocity and transitivity seem to be related to theselection of potential new collaboration partners. When the workshops without cognitive group awarenesssupport are contrasted to the workshops with cognitive group awareness support, we find that the reciprocitypattern disappears in both cases, while transitivity is still a significant selection pattern. This highlights theimportant role of previous collaboration partners, who can introduce different participants to each other. Theduration of a face-to-face interaction is also an important positive predictor for selecting a potential newcollaboration partner, with a more important role if no cognitive group awareness support is provided.Regarding the role of career level, we find in the overall model that PhD students reach out to otherresearchers as potential new collaboration partners to the same extent as experienced researchers. However, PhDstudents are chosen significantly less than experienced researchers as potential new collaboration partners. Inthe separated models, we do not find any career level related effects. Finally, we do not find any homophilousselection behavior among career levels. Looking at disciplinary backgrounds of the participants, we find in theoverall model and in the workshops without cognitive group awareness support that researchers with anInformation Technology background select significantly less potential new collaboration partners. However, thiseffect cannot be found in the workshops with cognitive group awareness support. We do not find differencesbetween disciplines in being chosen as potential new collaboration partners, nor do we find homophile behaviorin relation to disciplines.CSCL 2017 Proceedings524© ISLSTable 2: Models for the selection of potential new collaboration partnersOverall modelreciprocitytransitivityduration of interactionego career level (PhDstudent)alter career level (PhDstudent)homophily career levelegodiscipline(InformationTechnology)alterdiscipline(InformationTechnology)homophily disciplineWithout groupawareness supportWith group awarenesssupportEstimate (sd)pEstimate (sd)pEstimate (sd)p0.562 (0.541)0.261 (0.087)0.0003 (< 0.001)0.860 (1.1219).023< .001.010.1500.397 (0.462)0.269 (0.108)0.0004 (< 0.001).212.006.001.6540.719 (0.534)0.226 (< 0.001)0.0002 (< 0.001).062.001.014.174-0.500 (0.479).028-0.194 (0.703)-1.278 (1.344).452.036-0.012 (0.341).949-0.039 (0.258).800-0.270 (< 0.001)-0.412 (< 0.001)-0.140 (< 0.001)-2.266 (< 0.001)-0.832 (1.173)-0.220 (.0591).066.469.006.251.547-1.414 (1.379)-0.670 (1.074)-0.358 (1.235)-0.397 (1.162)0.105 (< 0.001)-0.044 (0.125).242.552.571.495.785DiscussionOur results have contrasting aspects. On the one hand, we have not been successful in explaining with howmany other researchers participants interacted during the scientific events considered. It might be that thevariables considered are not the relevant ones for understanding the initiation of face-to-face interaction butothers e.g. specific features of the workshop design or personality traits are more relevant. On the other hand,we were more successful in explaining the number of potential new collaboration partners the participants haveidentified after a workshop and in understanding the patterns that drive the selection process. The number ofprevious collaboration partners seems to play a major role, which is in line with the finding that transitivity is aconstant and relevant selection pattern. Lacking connections to other researchers seem to be the onlydisadvantage of PhD students, who join a meeting of a scientific community for the first time. The lack ofhomophily in the interaction patterns is in contrast with the results of Barrat, Cattuto, Szomszor, van denBroeck, and Alani (2010), who found clear signs of homophily with respect to career level in the face-to-faceinteractions. This discrepancy might be due to the number of participants in the individual workshops, whichpotentially makes it easier for researchers with different levels of experience to mingle or makes it moredifficult for the statistical analysis to uncover such detailed patterns. Moreover, we found that the longerresearchers interact with each other, the more likely it is that they will select each other as potentialcollaboration partners later on. This finding is complementary to the fact, found both here and by Barrat et al.(2010) that previous collaboration partners interacted for longer time on average than pairs of individuals whohad not collaborated prior to the workshop. An especially interesting finding for multi- / interdisciplinaryscientific communities is that participants’ background is a relevant factor for the number of potential newcollaboration partners and in the selection patterns and that cognitive group awareness was associated with lessdifferences in selection patterns between disciplines.However, it has to be noted that this study has several limitations, with the small sample size ofworkshops being the most important one. Also, the identification of potential new collaboration partners cannotbe assumed to equal actual new collaborations and further data about joint publications after the scientificevents needs to be analyzed. So far, we can only say that our results indicate that scientific communities seem toshare several selection patterns with other kinds of social networks, especially transitivity. However, otherexpected selection patterns, especially homophily, seem rather to depend on the group setting (larger vs. smallerscientific events).Furthermore, the literature on cognitive group awareness support has been controversial andour findings add new questions about who benefits from this kind of support.From a practical point of view, the findings indicate that tandems of a new member and an experiencedmember - as they have been initiated at ICLS 2016 - could be a very valuable endeavor for community buildingand newcomer integration. Furthermore, supporting cognitive group awareness may be especially helpful whenCSCL 2017 Proceedings525© ISLSdifferent disciplines come together. However, these findings need further replication and validation to justifythese conclusions and can so far only be seen as a first hint in these directions.ReferencesAiello, L.
