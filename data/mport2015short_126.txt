The study context was a university course concerningmathematics teaching practice. Analyses focused on (a) online collaborative lesson designactivities, and (b) classroom teaching practices.

To this end, apopular approach to teacher preparation is to help prospective teachers acquire core teaching knowledge andskills identified in literature or from exemplary model teachers (Hirsch, 1996; Slavin & Madden, 2001; Tileston,2000). Such practices are often associated with direct instruction that encourages practices based onword-for-word teaching scripts (Adams & Engelmann, 1996; Engelmann, 1980; Sawyer, 2004; Slavin &Madden, 2001). In contrast, an alternative approach is to guide teacher-education students to assume the role oftheory-builder or researcher, and to develop more adaptive disposition for sustained improvement in theirteaching practices (Bereiter, 2002). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether engagingteacher-education students in principle-based knowledge-building activities during their lesson design wouldhelp them perform more adaptive teaching practices.Mathematics teaching practicesPractice is essential to gain expertise. According to Hatano and Inagaki (1986), there are two general types ofexpertise: routine and adaptive. They conceptualized routine expertise as a core set of competencies that isdeveloped through high, but rather narrow, procedural proficiency. An essential dimension of routine expertiseis ‘efficiency’. As argued by Hammerness, Darling-Hammond, Bransford, Berliner, Cochran-Smith, McDonald,et al. (2005), efficiency means “greater abilities to perform particular tasks without having to devote too manyattentional resources to achieve them” (p. 361). In relation to teaching practices, routine expertise implies that ateacher is able to retrieve and appropriately apply a set of well-defined knowledge and skills to solve recurringteaching-related problems. When routine teaching expertise is pursued as an important goal forteacher-education, its aim is to help teacher-education students master some specified teaching knowledge andskills and apply them efficiently to solve common classroom problems. Typically, such knowledge and skills areidentified through research or model teaching (Goodnough, 2003; Hirsch, 1996; Slavin & Madden, 2001;Tileston, 2000) and are useful for implementing highly structured scripted teaching (Adams & Engelmann,1996). With routinized knowledge and skills, teachers can manage their class more efficiently, have control overwhat is to be taught, and cover the curricular materials more thoroughly. Previous research suggests that masteryof routinized teaching knowledge and skills improves students’ academic achievements in mathematics (Adams& Engelmann, 1996). Nevertheless, there are also disadvantages of such mode of teaching practice, as itemphasizes simple tasks more than complex problem-solving. Also, the teacher can become concerned mainlywith measurable learning outcomes. More importantly, this way of teaching does not take the teacher’s creativityand personality into consideration (Sawyer, 2004).In contrast to routine expertise, Hatano and Inagaki (1986) conceptualize another type of expertise—theadaptive type—as the ability and attitude to make adjustments in and add to core competencies in order toremain adaptive for future learning and development (Bransford & Schwartz, 1999; Schwartz & Martin, 2004).Unlike routine expertise, which emphasizes ‘efficiency’, an important dimension of adaptive expertise is‘innovation’; it means “moving beyond existing routines and often requires people to rethink key ideas,practices, and even values in order to change what they are doing” (Hammerness et al., 2005, p. 361).Accordingly, adaptive expertise in teaching implies that a teacher is able to solve recurring or novel teachingproblems by improvising alternative solutions, and can keep improving these solutions (Darling-Hammond &CSCL 2015 Proceedings	  47© ISLSBransford, 2005). When adaptive teaching expertise is deemed a primary knowledge goal to be pursued in ateacher-education program, learning (to teach) is more likely to emphasize the ability to adapt to newinstructional situations and to generate fresh ideas or solutions for addressing emerging teaching problems.Typically, such knowledge and skills are difficult to pre-define, and can only be gradually developed during theprocess of progressive problem-solving or knowledge-building for better teaching (Hong & Sullivan, 2009;Zhang, Hong, Scardamalia, Teo, & Morley, 2011). The essence of such teaching practices is therefore not tomodel one’s teaching after some exemplary teaching skills, but to engage in a mode of sustained improvement ofone’s own practices (Bereiter, 2002; Cohen, 1989; Sawyer, 2004; Darling-Hammond & Bransford, 2005;Hargreaves, 1999; Bereiter & Scardamalia, 1993).Knowledge buildingKnowledge building, also known as “deep constructivism” (Scardamalia, 2002, p. 4), is defined as a socialprocess focused on sustained community knowledge advancement (Scardamalia & Bereiter, 2006). Unlike mosteducational approaches that highlight learning through acquiring and accumulating well-established knowledge(Paavola, Lipponen, & Hakkarainen, 2004; Sfard, 1998), knowledge-building employs ideas as building blocksfor advancing deeper knowledge around a specific theme or topic. The importance of valuing ideas as basic unitsof thought or objects of inquiry can be manifested by means of Popper’s (1972) 3-World epistemicconceptualization. Popper refers to World-1 as an objective, natural/physical/material world, World-2 as asubjective psychological world constructed within the human mind, and World-3 as a conceptual worldconstituted mainly by ideas (e.g., theories, models). He argues that ideas are the creative results of human beings(such as engineers, scientists, researchers, artists, and the like) and that all forms of human knowledge arerelated to the creation of ideas in a human community (Scardamalia, 2002). Bereiter (2002) further argues thatideas are conceptual objects which, once produced in a public domain, can possess a social life of their own andcan be continually tinkered with, modified, and improved.To bring about productive community knowledge advancement through improving ideas, Scardamalia(2002) proposed a set of knowledge-building principles. For example, the principle of ‘idea diversity’ states that“[i]dea diversity is essential to the development of knowledge advancement, just as biodiversity is essential tothe success of an ecosystem. To understand an idea is to understand the ideas that surround it, including thosethat stand in contrast to it. Idea diversity creates a rich environment for ideas to evolve into new and morerefined forms” (p. 79) (see Scardamalia & Bereiter, 2010, for detailed descriptions for all principles). Typicalclassroom work is usually defined by pre-specified procedures (see e.g. Dick & Cary, 1990; Mager, 1975), clearrules and scripts (cf. Sawyer, 2004), or highly structured, routinized learning activities (e.g., Merrill, 1983;Gagne, Briggs, & Wagers, 1992) that represent fixed rather than improvable classroom procedures (cf. Hong &Sullivan, 2009). In contrast, knowledge-building highlights the use of abstract principles as guidelines toillustrate some pedagogical challenges that would pave the way towards sustained knowledge advancement forthe community’s work (Bereiter & Scardamalia, 2006).The present studyIn the field of computer-supported collaborative learning, there have been studies dedicated to teacher learning(e.g., Barab, MaKinster, & Scheckler, 2003; Greiffenhagen, 2012; Song & Looi, 2012). Particularly, there havebeen studies investigating the relationships between computer-supported collaborative knowledge building andteacher preparation or development (e.g., Cesareni, Martini, & Mancini, 2011; Chan, 2011; Chan & van Aalst,2006; Laferriere, Lamon, & Chan, 2006; van Aalst & Chan, 2001, Oshima et al., 2006) Nevertheless, fewstudies have actually explored specific instructional models or approaches in the knowledge building area forfostering adaptive mathematic teaching practices. To address such a challenge, this study proposes and tests aprinciple-based design approach (Hong & Sullivan, 2009; Zhang, Hong, Scardamalia, Teo, & Morley, 2011).Overall, the principle-based instructional design model is very different from conventional instructional designmodels that are inclined to foster routinized practices; for example, task-driven instructional design models(Dick & Carey, 1990), Criterion Referenced Instruction (Mager, 1975), and Component Display Theory (Merrill,1983). Such design approaches tend to emphasize the importance of employing well-defined procedures, rules,and/or componential tasks (Reigeluth, 1996) in order to help students acquire pre-defined knowledge and skills.In contrast, the proposed principled approach is characterized by the use of abstract principles to guide students’knowledge work. In the present study, the following three knowledge building principles were used, “ideaimprovement”, “epistemic agency”, and “community knowledge” (see detail below in the Method section), andthe present study intends to examine the proposed principled instructional design approach by answering thefollowing questions: (1) How do the principle-based knowledge building activities affect participants’ onlineCSCL 2015 Proceedings	  48© ISLSperformance and knowledge work (i.e., lesson design activities)? (2) How do the principle-based knowledgebuilding activities affect participants’ mathematics teaching practices?MethodStudy design, participants, and instructional contextThis case study gathered on-site data embedded in a course context. The duration of the study was a year—i.e.two semesters, with each semester lasting about 16 weeks. Participants were nine teaching-education students.The participants were planning to become middle-school mathematics teachers in Taiwan after graduation, sotook this university-level course entitled Middle School Mathematics Teaching. Major instructional activitiesthroughout the academic year were described as follows:(1) Lesson design ideas: Participants were guided to generate initial lesson ideas; then, they worked on thedetails such as setting instructive goals, preparing learning materials and worksheets, etc. One thing tonote is that before this activity, students were also encouraged to reflect back on the teaching problemsthey have encountered previously in order for them to go beyond their best practice.(2) Beyond best practice: Based on lesson design ideas, the participants performed their teaching practicesin class, with the rest of the classmates serving as the audience and critical reviewers. On average, eachteaching practice took about 25 minutes. All nine students in this course took turns to practice teaching.There were in total three lesson design cycles implemented in the whole school year.(3) Peer feedback: The teaching performance was then under critical review by all other classmates whowould individually comment on the practiced teaching by identifying issues, acknowledging strengths,and giving constructive feedback for improvement, etc.(4) Co-design discussion: All participants were further guided to collaboratively discuss some designquestions such as: “If you were to design this same lesson, how would you do differently to improvethe teaching practices?”; “What is your main design idea?”; “Why is it useful?”; “How is it going toimprove this particular teaching?” etc..(5) Reflection: The student who practiced her teaching could further reflect on her video-taped teaching,and online peer-feedback and co-design discussion comments, etc., in order to summarize all commentsand rise above previous lesson design ideas. Then, she will start to prepare for the next design cycle.In addition, the participants were also required to write reflection notes at the end of each practice and areflection paper at the end of the course.The lesson design activities were guided by a principled design approach, in particular, by using thefollowing three knowledge building principles: (1) idea improvement, (2) epistemic agency, and (3) communityknowledge. To elaborate, the principle of “idea improvement” highlights the importance of treating all lessonideas as improvable and that “[p]articipants work continuously to improve the quality, coherence, and utility ofideas. For such work to prosper, the culture must be one of psychological safety, so that people feel safe intaking risks—revealing ignorance, voicing half-baked notions, giving and receiving criticism” (p. 79); theprinciple of ‘epistemic agency’ states that “[p]articipants set forth their ideas and negotiate a fit betweenpersonal ideas and ideas of others, using contrasts to spark and sustain knowledge advancement rather thandepending on others to chart that course for them. They deal with problems of goals, motivation, evaluation, andlong-range planning that are normally left to teachers or managers” (p. 79); and the principle of ‘communityknowledge’ states that “[c]ontributions to shared, top-level goals of the organization are prized and rewarded asmuch as individual achievements. Team members produce ideas of value to others and share responsibility forthe overall advancement of knowledge in the community” (p. 80). The above principles were purposefullyselected because ideas (as building blocks of knowledge), agents (as knowledge workers), and community (asthe context for knowledge interaction and advancement) represents three essential knowledge-buildingcomponents. These principles were implicitly integrated into the lesson design activities, rather than explicitlytaught in class. For example, to integrate the “idea improvement” principle into the lesson design activities,participants were encourage to reflect on the authentic teaching problems they previously encountered, togenerate potential lesson design ideas for solving these problems, and to improve one another’s lesson ideasduring the feedback and co-design discussion activities; for the “epistemic agency” principle, students wereencouraged to take charge of the entire lesson design process from producing initial lesson ideas, practicingCSCL 2015 Proceedings	  49© ISLStheir teaching, negotiating with peers about feedback and co-design activities, to becoming a critically reflectivepractitioners; for the “community knowledge” principle, students were encouraged to work collaboratively as acommunity by engaging in idea exchange, feedback, and co-design discussion activities. It is important to notethat all the lesson design activities were only guided by the principles. Students were not required to practiceaccording to any teaching scripts for acquiring certain pre-scribed core teaching knowledge.Data source and analysisThe main datasets came from (a) participants’ online lesson design activities, and (b) video-taped teachingpractices. Moreover, students were required to write reflection notes after each teaching practice and a reflectionpaper at the end of the course. Using mixed-analysis approach, online collaborative activities were quantitativelyanalyzed, while online feedback/co-design/reflection comments, and teaching videos were content-analyzed.Using Chi’s (1997) coding techniques, qualitative data were quantified for performing inferential statistics. Thefollowing provides more details.First, online activity data recorded in the online database were analyzed focusing on two areas: (a)online activities (e.g., note creation and reading) and social dynamics (e.g., network density), and (b) the onlinefeedback/co-design/reflection comments in the three lesson design cycles. Student online activities wereanalyzed by means of non-parametric Wilcoxon signed rank tests. This analysis was employed to measure thedifference in terms of the amount of online activities between the two semesters. In addition, social networkanalysis was used to examine network density (which is defined as the sum of the values of all ties divided bythe number of possible ties) (Wasserman & Faust, 1994); the higher the number of the density, the stronger thesocial dynamics of a community is suggested. In addition, feedback/co-design/reflection comments orsuggestions to a possible course of improvement action were used as unit of analysis and they were parsed froma note if a note contained more than one specific comment/suggestion for a clear course of action for teachingimprovement (e.g., suggesting to give students more response time when asking a question). Content analysis onparticipants’ collaborative knowledge work based on the feedback/co-design/reflection comments was thenperformed. Zhang et al.’s (2007) concept of ‘inquiry thread’ was employed to trace participants’ collectivedesign improvement for teaching practice. Using an open coding process (Strauss & Corbin, 1990) to examineall 368 feedback/co-design/reflection comments recorded in the database, as a result, 12 different inquiry threadsunder two broad types of teaching practices were identified as follows: (1) efficiency-oriented (including“control over lesson plan”, “control over teaching strategies”, “control over class activity”, “control overpresentation skills”, “control over what to teach”, and “control over the use of teaching aids”; (2)innovation-oriented (including “adaptability in teaching design”, “flexibility in teaching strategies”, “interactivediscussion in class”, “open and engaging learning environments”, “improvised learning activities”, and “creativeuse of learning materials”). As an example, a student commented, “I realized that I should not spend too muchtime talking with students during my teaching practice so that I can more efficiently finish my planned teachingpractice in time.” (S6) and this comment was categorized under the “Control over lesson plan” thread theme.Two coders independently categorized all comments into different inquiry threads and a Kappa coefficient wascalculated to be .72. Additionally, using the number of feedback/co-design/reflection comments contributed inone particular teaching practice or in a given inquiry thread, the number of collaborators who worked together ina teaching practice or in an inquiry thread, and the number of reads (i.e., the number of times online commentswere read or referred or reflected by the participants in the database) as indicators, Wilcoxon signed rank testswere employed to illustrate whether there were any differences between efficiency-oriented andinnovation-oriented teaching practices in terms of students’ lesson design efforts.Regarding teaching practices, data mainly came from video-taping of students’ teaching practices. Inaddition, participants’ reflection notes written after each teaching practice were used as complementary data.Using activity as unit of analysis, the videotaped teaching practices were parsed from the video and classifiedinto various teaching activities. Next, classification of each activity during teaching practices was confirmed bythe participants themselves. Then, the activities were content-analyzed based on a coding scheme highlightingthree types of instructional activities (Collins, 1996): passive, active, and interactive learning. The passive modehighlighted instructional activities (mainly teacher-led) such as demonstration, direct instruction, lecture, askingfactual questions, and the like. The active mode highlighted students’ self--directed learning activities, such ashands-on exercises, independent work, quizzes, and the like. The interactive mode highlights team-basedinteractions (e.g., group discussion, group work, debate, or collaborative problem-solving). For the purpose ofanalysis, this study examined the percentage of time spent on each mode of activity for each of the four differentteaching practices. Two coders independently coded each class activity into a mode. The inter-coder kappa wascalculated to be 0.91.CSCL 2015 Proceedings	  50© ISLSResults and discussionIn this course, students were guided, under three knowledge-building principles, to work collaboratively as acommunity to help one another improve their lesson design and practice. To this end, they contributed designideas online and collaboratively worked with, and reflected on, these design ideas. All the online designactivities were documented in the online database. First, Table 1 shows overall online collaborative activities.Throughout the two semesters of a school year, participants contributed a total number of 160 notes (M=17.8and SD=4.29) in the first semester and 242 notes (M=26.9 and SD=2.52) in the second semester. There was asignificant increase from the first to the second semester for three main online collaborative activities, includingnumber of notes created, number of notes read, and number of notes built-on.Table 1.

To explore the collaborative design processes among participants, analysis wasperformed to look into how collaborative design activity was sustained over time. Overall, there were morecollaborative design efforts towards improving efficiency-oriented teaching practices than innovation-orientedteaching practices, as indicated by the number of comments (M=9.22, SD=3.45, for efficiency-oriented practices;M=4.41, SD=3.05, for innovation-oriented practices; z=-3.56, p<.001), the number of collaborators (M=6.26,SD=1.70, for efficiency-oriented practices; M=3.74, SD=2.46, for innovation-oriented practices; z=-3.16,p<.01), and the number of reads (M=67.41, SD=27.28, for efficiency-oriented practices; M=32.70, SD=23.25,for innovation-oriented practices; z=-3.48, p<.001). But when looking into each individual lesson design cycleover time, it was found that there was progressive change in collaborative design efforts towards less routinizedteaching practices and more adaptive teaching practices from the 1st to the 3rd design cycle. Specifically, in the1st cycle, collaborative design effort towards improving teaching practices was more routinized than adaptive, asindicated by the number of comments (M=11.67, SD=3.12, for efficiency-oriented practices; M=2.78, SD=2.39,for innovation-oriented practices; z=-2.68, p<.01), the number of collaborators (M=7.00, SD=0.87, forefficiency-oriented practices; M=2.67, SD=2.40, for innovation-oriented practices; z=-2.54, p<.05), and thenumber of reads (M=82.67, SD=27.17, for efficiency-oriented practices; M=19.67, SD=17.05, forinnovation-oriented practices; z=-2.67, p<.001). In the 2nd design cycle, as compared with the 1st design cycle,there were relatively less collaborative design efforts towards routinized practices and more collaborative designefforts towards adaptive practices, but the outcomes still remained quite the same that collaborative designefforts was more routine than adaptive, as indicated by the number of comments (M=9.44, SD=2.51, forefficiency-oriented practices; M=5.22, SD=2.95, for innovation-oriented practices; z=-2.14, p<.05), the numberof collaborators (M=6.67, SD=1.66, for efficiency-oriented practices; M=4.33, SD=2.50, for innovation-orientedpractices; z=-1.90, p=.058), and the number of reads (M=73.89, SD=20.26, for efficiency-oriented practices;M=40.78, SD=23.04, for innovation-oriented practices; z=-2.07, p<.05). In the 3rd design cycle, however, thedifference of collaborative design efforts between the routine and adaptive teaching practices became muchsmaller; all statistics comparisons were insignificant as evidenced by the number of comments (M=6.56,SD=2.79, for efficiency-oriented practices; M=5.22, SD=3.38, for innovation-oriented practices; z=-1.01,p=.313), the number of collaborators (M=5.11, SD=1.90, for efficiency-oriented practices; M=4.22, SD=2.39,for innovation-oriented practices; z=-.71, p=.48), and the number of reads (M=45.67, SD=20.73, forefficiency-oriented practices; M=37.67, SD=25.35, for innovation-oriented practices; z=-.83, p=.41). The resultssuggest that progressively the participants were developing a more adaptive disposition towards their teachingpractices.The content of participants’ feedbacks/co-design/reflection comments were further examined to explorehow collaborative design efforts for improving efficiency-oriented or innovation-oriented teaching practices wasqualitatively sustained over time. In terms of collaborative design efforts towards the efficiency-orientedteaching practices, for instance, the first inquiry thread in the figure (with 27 comments) was concerned withCSCL 2015 Proceedings	  51© ISLS“control over lesson plan”. In the 1st design cycle, it was found that the participants were highly concerned abouthow to implement their lesson plans efficiently. For example, as some participants suggested, “I realized that Ishould not spend too much time talking with students during my teaching practice so that I can more efficientlyfinish my planned teaching practice in time” (S6 in P3 or the 3rd practice); and “Based on my teaching plan, myteaching pace was too fast, so I need to slow down to better help students acquire the knowledge I want to teach”(S8 in P6). In the 2nd design cycle, the participants still paid much attention to whether they were teachingaccording to their lesson initially planned, even though there were relatively few feedbacks contributed. Forexample, some participants commented, “I need to be more consistent in my class management as I was alwaysbehind my teaching schedule” (S4 in P13), and “I need to carefully follow my lesson plan step by step to avoidunexpected interruption so that I can practice my teaching more as I planned” (S3 in P18). Moving towards the3rd design cycle, the number of comments contributed to the “control over lesson plan” thread was greatlyreduced and the comments also became less harsh; for example, “You may want to make sure there is still roomto include additional learning activities in your lesson plan” (S1 in P21); and “You still need to work on timemanagement, although you have done a good job to cover all the materials you planed to teach” (S9 in P24).These excerpts indicated that participants’ collaborative design efforts towards teaching practice becameprogressively less routine oriented.In contrast, participants’ collaborative design efforts towards more innovation-oriented teachingpractices were also qualitative changed over time. For example, in the inquiry thread titled “adaptability inteaching design” (which received 29 comments), it was found that the participants did not generate anycomments or ideas that were suggestive of more adaptable teaching practices in the 1st design cycle. Not untilthe 2nd design cycle, did they begin to produce and share comments related to adaptive teaching. For instance,some participants commented: “If you can flexibly provide more time for students to take over their learningpath, they will have different learning experiences and you will also learn how to teach in a less rigid manner”(S9 in P10); and “In my teaching practice in the second design cycle, I did not completely follow my teachingplan/script, but I tried to adapt my teaching methods based on how students responded to my instruction at themoment” (S8 in P13). Entering into the 3rd design cycle, it can be seen that participants’ disposition towardsinnovation-oriented practices was even more obvious. For example, some participants commented, “You havebeen dedicated to improving your teaching skills, but since every teacher has different personality traits, Isuggest that you think about how to adapt your teaching strategies by making good use of your personalitystrengths” (S1 in P22); and “You need to think about how to empathize with students in order to improvise theirlearning; the question is not how to teach, but to help students learn by using appropriate method at the rightmoment” (S6 in P25). These excerpts indicated a shift in collaborative design disposition towards progressivelymore innovation-oriented teaching practices.An intended goal of this course was to engage students in collaborative lesson design work for teachingimprovement. Therefore, it was posited that students would progressively become more comfortable workingcollaboratively in the Knowledge Forum. Overall, the increased online activities and enhanced social dynamicssuggested that this is the case. Additional content analysis on the online feedback/co-design/reflection commentsalso suggested that the participants were able to progressively develop a more adaptive disposition towardsmathematics teaching practices.Regarding class teaching practices, first, over a school year, each student performed three teachingpractices within three design cycles. So, in total, nine students performed 27 teaching practices. All 27 practiceswere video-taped and then uploaded online for peer feedback, co-design discussion, and self-reflection. Videoanalysis was conducted to examine changes in teaching practices. It was found that there was a progressivedecrease in trend in terms of the percentage of time used for passive learning activities, with the activity timespent in the three practices being 72.0% (SD=17.4%), 46.8% (SD=19.5%), and 38.4% (SD=17.1%). In contrast,there was a progressive increase in trend in terms of the percentage of time allocated to active learning activities,with the activity time spent in the practices being 17.0% (SD=12.9%), 36.4% (SD=18.6%), and 41.9%(SD=13.8%). Moreover, it was found that there was a progressive increase in the percentage of time allocated tointeractive learning activities, with the activity time spent in the practices being 10.0% (SD=14.0%), 16.2%(SD=13.3%), and 23.8% (SD=12.2%).Concluding remarkAs ‘deep constructivism’ (Scardamalia, 2002, p. 4), knowledge-building attempts to guide classroom activitiesaway from proceduralized tasks to innovative knowledge work (Zhang, Hong, Scardamalia, Teo, & Morley,2011). ), Previous studies ranging from the elementary-school classroom setting to university context providedconvincing examples of what students can achieve in knowledge-building classrooms in the advancement ofCSCL 2015 Proceedings	  52© ISLSknowledge (e.g., see a special issue of the Canadian Journal of Learning and Technology on knowledge-building,Volume 36/1). In the present study, the findings further suggested that engaging teacher-education students insustained knowledge-building in a teacher-education course could help the teacher-education students (a) learnto teach with progressively more adaptive manner, and (b) develop more adaptable practices. In conclusion, thisstudy shows that the principle-based design approach was viable for guiding teacher-education students todevelop more adaptive teaching practices.ReferencesAdams, G.L., & Engelmann, S.
