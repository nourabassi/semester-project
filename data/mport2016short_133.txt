Effects of Implicit Guidance on Contribution Quality in a WikiBased Learning EnvironmentSven Heimbuch and Daniel Bodemer,sven.heimbuch@uni-due.de, bodemer@uni-due.deUniversity of Duisburg-Essen, GermanyAbstract: Learning within the scope of collaborative knowledge construction with Wikis offersopportunities for triggering socio-cognitive conflicts through controversies. Since the nature ofdiscussions between users in Wikis is not easily recognisable, we were investigating the effectsof visual highlighting as controversy awareness information. In this study we wanted to enableN = 81 participants to produce contributions of higher quality due to focused selection towardsrelevant contents. We conducted both qualitative and quantitative analyses on Wikicontributions. The addition of visual highlights indicating controversies reinforced students todirect their attention towards important contents discussing the study’s subject matter. Whentheir selection behaviour was positively influenced it resulted in higher quality and moreelaborate contributions to discussion threads and to the final revision of an article. We concludethat unobtrusive implicit guidance can facilitate collaborative knowledge constructionprocesses and outcomes.IntroductionThe processes of collaborative knowledge construction with Wikis can be difficult and challenging to users bycausing frustration for learners (e.g. Capdeferro & Romero, 2012). This can be either due to its structural setupthat is unfamiliar to many first time contributors or the manifold options such a system offers where anybody canedit virtually anything at anytime from anywhere. As a consequence, Wikis provide a fertile ground forcontroversies and socio-cognitive conflicts to occur. Controversies that are constructive and grounded on theexchange of opinions and different points of view on a specific topic provide opportunities for triggering learningrelevant processes and resulting in higher learning outcomes (e.g. Johnson & Johnson, 1979). These kinds ofcontroversies can induce socio-cognitive conflicts that can be beneficial for learning (e.g. Mugny & Dosie, 1978),by triggering equilibration processes of accommodation and assimilation of new knowledge artefacts into one’sindividual cognitive system (Piaget, 1977).In extensions to the individual learner’s perspective on socio-cognitive conflicts, conflicts between thesocio-technical system and the cognitions of a collaborative user base are explicated in the theory of co-evolutionin collaborative knowledge construction (Cress & Kimmerle, 2008). Every individual’s cognitive system that isparticipating in collaborative knowledge construction provides potentials for possible conflicts to occur whileinternalizing or externalizing socially shared artefacts from or into a Wiki as socio-technical system (e.g. Oeberst,Halatchliyski, Kimmerle & Cress, 2014). Collaborative knowledge construction processes with the ability toinduce conflicts in either system can mutually influence each other.In Wikis lie potentials for collaborative knowledge construction with regard to desirable constructivecontroversies and socio-cognitive conflicts that can be beneficial for a number of learning processes, suchoccurrences should be made more salient to the user. One approach to achieve this is the implementation ofimplicit scaffolding measures, such as providing representational guidance (Suthers, 2003) and additionalcognitive group awareness information (Bodemer, 2011). Representational guidance has proven to be effectiveon having an impact on group and individual performances during collaborative tasks by directing participantswith external representations, such as minimal obtrusive textual or visual contextual cues (e.g. Chun & Jiang,1998). Especially the use of representational guidance implementations making use of graphics in computersupported collaborative learning showed potentials of resulting in higher quality written texts as outcomes (e.g.Janssen, Erkens, Kirschner & Kanselaar, 2010).In addition to that, cognitive group awareness tools that are focused on gathering and visualizingknowledge-related contextual cues have been successfully implemented as implicit guidance measures to structurecollaborative learning processes (e.g. Bodemer & Dehler, 2011). It has been showed that implementations of toolsthat make specific contributions more salient provide the opportunity to strengthen a group’s influence on othersand foster learning processes as a result (e.g. Buder & Bodemer, 2008). In large scale online discussions additionalvisualisations have been proven as effective to implicitly guide readers by promoting a more selective readingbehaviour and consequently result in better learning outcomes (e.g. Buder, Schwind, Rudat & Bodemer, 2015).Adding visual support for increasing salience towards discussions about controversial opinions or contradictoryICLS 2016 Proceedings906© ISLSevidence can support the induction of socio-cognitive conflicts. These conflicts have the potentials to initiaterestructuring processes of one’s own cognitive system as well as within the socio-technical system that is used forcollaborative knowledge construction.In previous analyses Heimbuch and Bodemer (2014, 2015) reported that specific highlighting ofdiscussions in Wikis with the objective of promoting controversy awareness guides learners towards most relevantcontents. This implicit guidance was the result of a more focused selection towards relevant information andfurthermore lead to measurably higher positive learning outcomes. Other Wiki-related research has been focusedon identifying qualitative indicators by means of article revision metrics (e.g. Halfaker, Kittur, Kraut & Riedl,2009) or the usage of content analysis for exploratory classifications of discussion page contributions (e.g.Schneider, Passant & Breslin, 2011), but without analysing and comparing the quality of individual contributions.Thus far, it was still unknown what effects additional controversy highlights to a Wiki discussion page have onthe quality of the individual contributions to an article and the corresponding discussion threads. Therefore, weconducted detailed qualitative analyses on article and discussion thread contributions of this Wiki-based studywhere additional visual highlighting aids as implicit guidance have been implemented.MethodThis experimental study has been conducted in a controlled laboratory setting with N = 81 university students(Mage = 21.70, SD = 2.76), mainly recruited from studies of Applied Cognitive and Media Science. They wererandomly assigned to one of three versions of our learning environment, separated by privacy screens. They hadto contribute to a pre-existing article and discussions. Due to technical issues at the experiment’s editing stage,some of our analyses had to be performed with a total number of N = 79 participants.The independent between-subjects factor consisted of three experimental groups reflecting differentlevels of implicit scaffolding through additionally visualised cognitive group awareness information on theoccurrence of content-related controversies. Every group’s Wiki had the same Wikipedia-like structure of thediscussion page and identical contents inside the discussion threads. Participants had the task to edit an article ontheories of mass extinction events of dinosaurs (“Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event”). The study wasdivided into two phases: (1) reading the original article and corresponding discussions and (2) contribute to selfselected discussions and edit the article. The control group was provided with a Wiki article and discussion viewwhich was similar to Wikipedia. The other experimental groups had additional visual highlights to the discussionpage in form of visual controversy awareness information on the thread title level.We conducted qualitative content analyses (Mayring, 2014) on the final edits of the individual Wikiarticles and on the discussion replies of each participant. The finally derived coding schemes and categoryformations originated both from deductive and inductive procedures. Wiki article categories have been assigneddeductively in accordance with Wikipedia’s guidelines for evaluating an article’s quality. Categories with regardto a discussion reply’s content quality have been formed in an inductive procedure.ResultsIn the following we will present the immediate effects on the contribution quality on the level of discussion threadswhere the controversy awareness indication was implemented. We further explore the indirect effects on thearticle level where knowledge artefacts needed to be transferred from the materials inside the different types ofdiscussions.By using a tertile split on the categorised discussion reply data, over all experimental groups andparticipants, 30.86% of all participant contributions were rated as lower quality, 58.02% as medium quality and11.11% as high quality contributions. These numbers are total aggregates of categories associated with discussionreply quality. Reply quality was composed of Neutrality (acknowledging both opposing arguments), New Aspects(introducing new knowledge artefacts) and Summarising (integrating summaries of preceding discussion).Aaggregated quality ratings for reply contributions are presented in table 1.Table 1: Frequencies (and percentages) of cumulative overall quality ratings of discussion thread replies.Lower qualityMedium qualityHigh qualityICLS 2016 ProceedingsNo highlight12 (44.44%)13 (48.15%)2 (7.41%)Controversy highlight5 (18.52%)19 (70.37%)3 (11.11%)907+ Status highlight8 (29.63%)15 (55.56%)4 (14.81%)© ISLSOver all groups and participants, 16.46% of all final articles were rated as lower quality, 51.90% asmedium quality and 31.65% as high quality edits.

Virtually everybody can change any contents at any time in a Wiki which in turncan lead to the occurrence of controversies about contents that can subsequently induce socio-cognitive conflicts.In the present analysis we examined how the quality of contributions has been affected by adding visualcontroversy information to relevant discussion threads.We found that highest quality contributions were marginally more frequent when the level of controversyawareness information was raised by providing additional indication on the resolution status. We could also seethat when controversy awareness without additional status information was provided the most contributions ofmedium quality could be found, as well as the lowest number of participants who did not summarise relevantpreceding discussions.Although the numbers were only marginal, we identified the highest overall quality article in theexperimental group that has received the most detailed level of controversy awareness and status information. Butwe also see a rather positive effect for the experimental group that did not receive the controversy statusinformation, since they produced the smallest number of lower quality articles. These findings that are in favourof the effects of the more general information on the mere occurrence of controversies can be due to similar effectsthat have been found in previous Wiki-related research on collaborative knowledge construction. Medium levelsof incongruity of information between the individual cognitive and the socio-technical system have been provento be the most beneficial for learning (Moskaliuk, Kimmerle & Cress 2009) as well as medium levels ofredundancy fostered external accommodation processes (Moskaliuk, Kimmerle & Cress, 2012). The findings ofthis present analysis are line with research that medium levels of supportive manipulations to scaffold learningprocesses are beneficially for a number of collaborators.Finally, in conjunction with our previous quantitative findings (Heimbuch & Bodemer, 2014) theseresults show that additional representations of controversy awareness information can be effective for the resultingknowledge artefacts. This implicit scaffolding that is designed to help Wiki users to focus and select importantcontents has shown to be beneficial for effective learning and the outcome in terms of higher quality knowledgeconstruction artefacts.Although this experimental study has been conducted with individuals in a laboratorysetting, due to the deployed scenario of Wiki-based knowledge construction the potentials of implicit guidanceshould be considered for further research on collaborative knowledge construction environments. These findingsare relevant for the learning sciences, especially for designing and implementing scaffolding interventions forcomputer-supported collaborative learning environments.ReferencesBodemer, D.
