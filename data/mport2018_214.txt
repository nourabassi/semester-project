‚ÄúI‚Äôm Going to Fail‚Äù: How Youth Interpret Failure Across ContextualBoundariesAmber Simpson, Binghamton University, asimpson@binghamton.eduAlice Anderson, Minneapolis Institute of Art, aanderson@artsmia.orgAdam Maltese, Indiana University, amaltese@indiana.eduMegan Goeke, Science Museum of Minnesota, mgoeke@smm.orgAbstract: Previous research on youth‚Äôs perceptions and reactions to failure established a viewof failure as a negative, debilitating experience for youth, yet STEM and in particular makingprograms increasingly promote a pedagogy of failures as productive learning experiences.Looking to unpack perceptions of failure across contexts and potential differences between selfidentified sexes, youth who participated in making activities were interviewed about theirexperiences with failure and thoughts about the term. Youth‚Äôs perceptions of failure fell intofour categories: failure as enhancing, failure as debilitating, failure as mosaic, and failure asfluid. For the majority of youth (70%), their perception of failure transcended situationalboundaries and was not entirely negative as previous research suggested. These results haveimplications on design of learning contexts and complicate prevailing understandings of youths‚Äôfailure experiences.Problem statementWithin science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, failure has been viewed as thepoint in which an individual stops an activity (Thomas, 2014); as giving up or not trying (Lottero-Perdue & Parry,2014); as not obtaining an expected goal or outcome (Bidjerano, 2010); and as a learning opportunity (Simpson& Maltese, 2017). Research has illustrated how youths‚Äô reactions to failure include hopelessness, depression,embarrassment, negative self-feelings, decrease of interest in a subject area, and reduced time in extracurricularactivities, to name a few (e.g., Guler, 2013; Riketta & Ziegler, 2007). Moreover, youth tend to attributeexperiences with failure to external loci or factors out of their control (Weiner, 1986), such as boring presentations,unclear expectations, and task difficulty (e.g., Boruchovitch, 2004). As such, the presence of failures within andeducational experience and youths‚Äô reactions to failures typically dwell in a negative space, despite the promotionof failures to spur innovation or inventions (Martin, 2014).However, an emerging literature on experiences of failure within the making context suggests that theadded complexities of open-ended design (Litts et al., 2016), hands-on materials (Sheridan et al., 2016) andmultiple resources and supports (Ryoo et al., 2015) have the potential to reframe failure in a more positive light.As such, the focus for this study was on making contexts as failure is considered an inherent and productive partof making (e.g., Martin, 2015), which may drive learning through reflection and the process of coming unstuck(Kapur, 2008). We present this work to continue building upon this making-related scholarship by posing thefollowing research question: How does youths‚Äô view of failure transcend beyond making contexts and activities,if at all? We define making contexts as situations or spaces that invoke the creation of a tangible (e.g., robot) ordigital object (e.g., computer program) for a purpose or play (Vossoughi & Bevan, 2014). Making activities aredefined as the type of task, problem, and/or investigation the maker is engaged including the available tools,materials, human resources, and support.Theoretical groundingThis study is grounded in the notion of boundaries, specifically the concepts of boundary objects and boundarycrossing (Akkerman & Bakker, 2011). Boundary objects are defined as concrete or abstract artifacts that inhabitmultiple intersecting sites and can ‚Äúadapt to local needs and the constraints of the several parties employing them,yet robust enough to maintain a common identity across sites‚Äù (Star & Griesemer, 1989, p. 393). Here, weconceptualize the word failure as a boundary object that has different meanings for different people acrossmultiple contexts, known as a boundary crossing. As such, a boundary crossing is defined as transitions orinteractions across sites (Suchman, 1994). In this study, boundary crossings include making, academic, andsporting contexts, among others. This theoretical grounding also affords researchers to consider the potential ofboundary objects to invoke learning opportunities for youth (Akkerman & Bakker, 2011).MethodologyICLS 2018 Proceedings981¬© ISLSThis study is part of larger study in which we are examining how youth and educators attend, interpret, andrespond to failure while engaging in making and tinkering activities. This particular study was situated within twolocations that implement maker programming for youth, an informal educational setting (i.e., museum) and aformal educational setting (i.e., public middle school), both within the United States. Youth in grades 4-8 (ages9-14) volunteered to be interviewed regarding their perception and experiences with failure after participating inmaking-related activities within one of three contexts (i.e., summer camp, drop-in, school), and how this comparedto their perception and experiences with failure in other areas of their life. We interviewed 133 youth: 43 in anacademic setting, 46 enrolled in a week-long maker focused summer camp held at a science museum, and 44 inan informal drop-in exploration setting at the same museum. Participants across the three contexts were engagedin a variety of making-related activities, which we categorized using Bevan‚Äôs (2017) three types of educativeMaker activities - assembly, creative construction, and tinkering. Assembly refers to activities that are structuredor procedural; creative construction to activities that were based on a pre-set design goal and included someconstraints; and tinkering to activities that provided opportunities for exploration and experimentation without agoal in mind. Interviews averaged 13 minutes in length and were transcribed verbatim.Data analysisEach interview was analyzed by two researchers using a constant-comparative holistic coding process as theresearch team had an idea of what might emerge from the data based on experiences with youth in makerspaces(Fram, 2013; Salda√±a, 2013). Researchers read and reread through each interview to gain an understanding ofyouths‚Äô mindset around failure across various sites. Specifically, we utilized and built upon Dweck‚Äôs (2006)scholarship on fixed and growth mindsets. As argued by Dweck, individuals‚Äô mindsets tend to change based oncontext (e.g., mathematics versus art class). From our analysis, four categories surfaced: failure as enhancing,failure as debilitating, failure as mosaic, and failure as fluid. Failure as Enhancing indicates a view of failure asan opportunity for growth and opens up a space for moving forward productively; a learning-oriented perspective.Failure as Debilitating indicates a view of failure as hindering one‚Äôs progress and a need for help to continuetoward one‚Äôs goal or end product; a performance-oriented perspective. Failure as Mosaic indicates a view offailure as enhancing in some contexts and debilitating in other contexts. Lastly, Failure as Fluid indicates neithera positive or negative view of failure; allowing failure to direct a course of action through a ‚Äúgo with the flow‚Äùmentality. Next, we conducted two Kruskal-Wallis tests (by making context and by making activity) to determineif statistically significant differences existed among the four groups or four categories. If differences were found,researchers conducted post hoc Mann-Whitney U test to evaluate pairwise differences among the four groups. Tocontrol for Type I error, the researchers used the Bonferroni correction (ùõºùõº = .008).FindingsWith the exception of Failure as Mosaic perspective, youths‚Äô views of failure did not change based on context orsituation; thus, their views of failure seem to transcend multiple settings. Table 1 and Table 2 displays youths‚Äôperspective of failure based on the making context and the making-related activity, respectively. Descriptives arepresented as number of participants and percentages.Table 1: Youths‚Äô perspective of failure by making context.Failure as EnhancingFailure as DebilitatingFailure as MosaicFailure as FluidSchool22 (16.5%)3 (2%)17 (13%)1 (0.8%)Summer Camp17 (13%)13 (10%)15 (11%)1 (0.8%)Drop-In13 (10%)15 (11%)8 (6%)8 (6%)Total52 (39%)31 (23%)40 (30%)10 (8%)Table 2: Youths‚Äô perspective of failure by making activity.Failure as EnhancingFailure as DebilitatingFailure as MosaicFailure as FluidICLS 2018 ProceedingsAssembly15 (11%)11 (8%)11 (8%)0 (0%)Creative Construction22 (16.5%)14 (10.5%)23 (17%)2 (1.5%)982Tinkering15 (11%)6 (4.5%)6 (4.5%)8 (6%)¬© ISLSFailure as Enhancing is exemplified by youths‚Äô view of failure as a means to make improvements eitherin the process of making, or in not manufacturing the same ‚Äúmistake‚Äù the next time whether in school, in making,in cooking or in sporting events. In other words, failure is viewed as an opportunity to learn regardless of context.For example, a youth in the academic setting stated, ‚ÄúSetbacks and failure can both teach you. Whilst I wasworking with this I tried out several tools and several tools failed so I have more of an understanding of what theydo and how to accomplish what I want.‚Äù This was discussed within a three-dimensional design of a fictionalstarship from a popular television show, as well as within mathematics. Fifty-two of the 133 youth (39%) in thisstudy exhibited this perspective.Failure as Debilitating is similar to a fixed mindset; framed here as a negative view of failure personally(e.g., low confidence) and in limiting one‚Äôs progress toward the end product or expected outcome. Youth are notconcerned with learning from failure, but focused on completion and correctness. For instance, failure implieshopelessness in the following quote.When something breaks or something doesn‚Äôt go correctly, and you can‚Äôt do anything about it. Like ifyou lost something and you can‚Äôt re-find it. . . . When you get an assignment wrong and you can‚Äôt redoit or if you take a test and you miss the whole thing, you can't redo the test.As with Failure as Enhancing, this perspective transcends multiple contexts and was expressed by 31 of the 133youth (23%) in this study.Failure as Mosaic does not transcend sites as youths‚Äô perspective of failure changes based on context.In this study, views within making context were typically Failure as Enhancing, while views in other contexts,academic contexts for example, were typically Failure as Debilitating. For example, one youth noted how thecamp setting was less serious and expressed having the ability to try new things, whereas failure in a school settingwas more serious and may lead to one stating, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to fail. I‚Äôm not going to make it.‚Äù Moreover, thisperspective of failure varied by classroom contexts, school subjects, and/or academic tasks. The following quotecaptures this idea. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a difference between my core classes and this class because, in this class [CreativeDesign], if you fail you can re-do it. And, in other classes, you can't retake tests multiple times.‚Äù In this study, 40of the 133 youth (30%) did not view failure the same across multiple sites or boundary crossings.Failure as Fluid was less often expressed by youth in this study (n = 10, 8%). One youth building anystructure or object using small rubber bands and small wooden dowels commented, that after his structure fellapart, ‚ÄúI don't really know what I did, I just started putting sticks together. I just put more rubber bands on it.‚ÄùUpon further probing, the youth was unable to articulate how he decided to make changes. As exemplified in thisquote, failure is not positioned as a learning opportunity (i.e., Failure as Enhancing) nor as being detrimental (i.e.,Failure as Debilitating), but as some thing or abstract boundary object that just occurs and tends to work itselfout for better or for worse.Lastly, in conducting Kruskal-Wallis tests, a significant difference was found for how youth viewed andexperienced failure in different learning environments based on the making activity (œá2(3, 133) = 14.205, p =.003), but not the making context (œá2(3, 133) = 5.438, p = .142). The follow-up analysis revealed that youth witha Failure as Enhancing perspective (p = .002), Failure as Debilitating perspective (p = .001), and Failure asMosaic perspective (p = .0001) differed significantly from youth with a Failure as Fluid perspective.Significance and implicationsMore often than not (approximately 70%), youths‚Äô views of failure in this study transcend across boundaries orcontexts, as well as making activities. These views were framed as opportunities for growth (i.e., Failure asEnhancing) more often than views framed as limiting one‚Äôs progress (i.e., Failure as Debilitating), 39% and 23%,respectively. This finding seems to both confirm and contradict research that situates failure as only a negativeexperience (e.g., Guler, 2013). It seems that youths‚Äô views of failure are on par with professionals across STEMfields (Simpson & Maltese, 2017). Additionally, youth continuing to view failure as a negative experienceregardless of context, particularly in a making setting where there is a focus on rapid prototyping and celebratingfailure as part of the process of creative design (e.g., Martin, 2015), is of concern as it diminishes the opportunityto learn across boundaries.Furthermore, about 30% of youths‚Äô views of failure in this study did not transcend across boundaries,but changed based on context and making activity. Youth who expressed Failure as Mosaic most often exhibitedFailure as Enhancing during making-related activities, implying the potential power of making in shifting one‚Äôsview of failure across multiple sites, which in turn may invoke learning opportunities for youth (Akkerman &Bakker, 2011). This may indicate a transition to viewing failure as a learning opportunity regardless of contexts;hence, transitioning to a view of failure that transcends boundaries. Likewise, youth here expressed Failure asICLS 2018 Proceedings983¬© ISLSDebilitating during school contexts, and even sporting events, as youth were typically not afforded an opportunityto re-do mistakes and/or failures. Therefore, a change in the learning context and/or task could potentially shiftthese youths‚Äô views of failure within an academic setting from negative experiences to positive experiences.ReferencesAkkerman, S.
