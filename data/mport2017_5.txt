Collaborative Learning on Multi-Touch Interfaces: ScaffoldingElementary School StudentsLara Johanna Schmitt and Armin Weinbergerl.schmitt@edutech.uni-saarland.de, a.weinberger@edutech.uni-saarland.deEduTech, Saarland UniversityAbstract: Multi-touch interfaces allow for direct and simultaneous input by several co-presentlearners. Additional scaffolding may or may not be needed to ease or problematize tasks thatinvolve intuitive bodily experiences. In this study, a tablet app (“Proportion”) is supposed toenable two novices (about 10 years old) to collaboratively construct an understanding ofproportional relations. In a 2×2 factorial design (n =162), effects of facilitating strategy prompts(with / without) and problematizing verbalization prompts (with / without) regarding thevariables task focus, emotions, quality of dialogue and learning gains have been investigated.While the strategy prompts did not have any significant influence, the verbalization promptshad versatile effects: On one hand, quality of talk was improved, on the other hand, task focusand emotions were negatively affected. Learning gains were limited to near transfer task typesand comparable over conditions.Keywords: collaborative learning, embodiment, proportional reasoning, scaffolding, tabletsMulti-touch interfaces for collaborative embodied learningMulti-touch interfaces allow for co-present collaborative learning and, specifically, for equal, simultaneous, anddirect manipulation of a learning environment (Roschelle et al., 2010). Using a multi-touch interface together cansupport beneficial forms of interactions, like whole-group discussions, fluid interactions (Alvarez, Brown, &Nussbaum, 2011), equal participation, and joint time on task, while process losses are reduced (Mercier, Higgins,& da Costa, 2014). The direct manipulation is supposed to reduce the “cognitive distance between intent andexecution” (Rick, 2012; p. 316) and also enables forms of embodied learning experiences (Schneps et al., 2014),using the body to interact with a tool in order to construct knowledge. Despite the possible benefits of embodiedapproaches in learning mathematics (Abrahamson & Lindgren, 2014), embodied hands-on learning activities mayprovoke off-task behavior and distract from the actual learning goals (e.g., Danish, Enyedy, Saleh, Lee, &Andrade, 2015), thus come at the cost of verbalization, abstraction, and reflection of knowledge. Hence, additionalscaffolding for reflection may constructively complement, but may also disrupt the embodied learningexperiences. To address this issue, the present study examines to what extent scaffolding can support learning inan embodied learning environment or not.Scaffolding CSCL with collaboration scriptsSupporting learners’ (inter-)actions for knowledge construction can take various forms. One widely applied formis scripting of collaborative processes, which focuses on fostering reflection (Kobbe et al., 2007). Building andsharing arguments together may productively coalesce with embodied learning experiences, helping to translatebetween embodied experience and abstract conceptualization. A large body of research shows that argumentativepractices can be facilitated in CSCL scenarios through scripting (e.g., Gijlers, Weinberger, van Dijk, Bollen, &van Joolingen, 2013).One of the core design questions of scripting to scaffold collaborative learning processes is whetherscripts should make the task easier or harder (Reiser, 2004): On one hand, learners often need structural or strategicsupport to proceed in task solution processes; providing this support, by e.g. reducing the complexity of a task orlearning environment, is making the task easier. For example, scaffolding can guide learners to better understandwhat they have to do, what is a sensible sequence of activities, or where should they focus their attention (Jackson,Krajcik, & Soloway, 1998). Those strategic types of scaffolds are prospective, i.e. directed to future behavior.One goal of scripting is internalization of effective scripts by the learner (Fischer, Kollar, Stegmann, & Wecker,2013). On the other hand, learners’ understanding can be enhanced by problematizing aspects of the tasks; to thisend, prompting reflection and verbalization is feasible; contrary to the first way of scaffolding, it is making thetask harder (Reiser, 2004). Stopping learners from superficial and fast problem solving and prompting them toengage in verbalizations, aims at fostering deep elaboration of the learning material (King, 1990). The quality oflearners’ interactive talk has been found to positively relate to learning (Paus, Werner, & Jucks, 2012; Teasley,CSCL 2017 Proceedings9© ISLS1995; Webb, 1989). Scaffolding learners to reflect typically is a retrospective, thus reflective activity, directedinto the past.So potentially, there is a need for enriching embodied learning experiences on multi-touch interfaceswith scripting for deliberate activities, reflective collaborative discourse, or both. In this paper, we considerwhether prompting learners to apply heuristics that make the task easier and / or prompting learners to verbalizeunderlying mathematical concepts, abstract from the immediate experience and hence making the task moredifficult, can facilitate processes and outcomes of co-located CSCL using multi-touch devices. While positiveeffects can be assumed, the opposite might happen: Do well-meant prompts actually interfere with intuitiveembodied learning environments? While prompts theoretically would improve cognition and problem solvingstrategies, their sudden appearance during gameplay can also seriously ruin the experience (Wouters et al., 2015).Scaffolding could be both: counterproductive, thus ruining and disrupting the bodily, hands-on learningexperience, or complementary, thus improving and supplementing it with processes of encoding that are necessaryfor memorization and learning.Proportional reasoningProportional reasoning is defined as “reasoning with ratios, rates, and percentages” (Jitendra, Star, Rodriguez,Lindell, & Someki, 2011, p. 731) and is a central topic in mathematics (Boyer, Levine, & Huttenlocher, 2008).Children typically have difficulties with it; particularly handling fractions is a problem (Mix, Levine, &Huttenlocher, 1999). Reinholz, Trninic, Howison, and Abrahamson (2010) blame a lack of senso-motorical,embodied experiences for causing difficulties in handling proportions. Researchers identified typicalmisconceptions that children face in proportional reasoning tasks: First, application of counting strategies toproportions, especially when concrete units are presented (Boyer et al., 2008). Second, application of additionrules to proportions (Mix et al., 1999). Third, failure to form correct proportional representations from discreteunits, that is not building a relative relationship between numerator and denominator of a fraction (Boyer et al.,2008; Mix et al., 1999). Fostering proportional reasoning requires effective learning set-ups. Research showedthat collaboration in combination with hypothesis testing has the potential to live up to that (Ellis, Klahr, & Siegler,1993). Recent developments also aim at including embodied learning experiences. Similar to the MathematicalImage Trainer (Reinholz et al., 2010), we have developed the "Proportion" iPad app that aims at improvingchildren's proportional reasoning by letting them directly manipulate proportional relations.Research question and hypothesesThis study clarifies the following research question utilizing a 2×2 design: To what extent can collaborativelearning with tablets be supported by different types of prompts (facilitating strategy prompts / “STRAT” vs.problematizing verbalization prompts / “VERB”), regarding learning processes and outcomes?• Hypothesis 1: STRAT prompts and VERB prompts and their combination will result in higher taskfocus. Facilitating the task with the STRAT prompts should help learners to make progress and stay ontrack. Problematizing the task with the VERB prompts also should direct learners’ attention to relevanttask features.• Hypothesis 2: The STRAT prompts will induce more positive emotions; the VERB prompts will inducemore negative emotions. Making the task easier (STRAT) is supposed to trigger positive emotions likeenjoyment, because task progression is facilitated. Making the task harder (VERB) is supposed to resultin negative emotions like frustration or anger, because task progression is slowed down by difficult verbaltasks.• Hypothesis 3: The VERB prompts will enhance the quality of dialogic interactions. Explicitly requestinglearners to externalize their knowledge and engage in discussions should result in higher transactivityand higher epistemic quality.•Hypothesis 4: STRAT prompts and VERB prompts and their combination will result in higher learninggains, regarding both near and far transfer task types. The internalization of task solving strategiessuggested by the STRAT prompts should have a positive impact on learning. Higher-order verbalizationsas scaffolded by the VERB prompts impact learning positively by promoting deeper elaboration andmultiple perspectives.CSCL 2017 Proceedings10© ISLSMethodsSampleParticipants (fourth graders; mean age: 10.34 years (SD=.55); 50% male) were acquired from seven primaryschools in Germany. All participants had a consent form signed by their legal representatives, informing on datacollection and analyses. In total, n=162 participants took part in the experiments, being tested in four differentexperimental conditions (control, STRAT, VERB, and VERB-STRAT). χ²-tests and ANOVAs did not revealstatistically significant differences between conditions regarding the control variables gender, handedness,experience with or owning of a multi-touch device, pre-test or –questionnaire.MaterialThe learning environment “Proportion” is an iPad application (Rick, 2012). The interface is designed to affordincorporation of hand / arm movements, i.e. aiming at actively experiencing and embodying proportional relations.The app consists of a fixed sequence of 21 levels with 5 to 23 tasks each. In Proportion, learners control two bars(orange and blue) that are positioned vertically next to each other. To solve the tasks, learners need to resize thebars, so that they are in the right relation to each other as indicated by the associated numbers. See figure 1a foran example: In this case, the bars need to be resized so that the left bar’s height would be 2/3 compared to theright one. Once a task is solved, the numbers of the next task appear. An owl acts as a pedagogical agent andprovides feedback, e.g. announces “correct” once a task is solved. The owl also voices the varied prompts; seefigure 1b and 1c. The prompt versions (A, B, or C; see table 1) alternate in the same fashion for all dyads in theprompted conditions: After the first task of each level, one STRAT (in the STRAT condition), one VERB (in theVERB condition), or both prompts (in the VERB-STRAT condition) appear on the screen.Table 1: Overview on promptsVersionABCLevel1, 4, 7, 10,13, 16, 192, 5, 8, 11,14, 17, 203, 6, 9, 12,15, 18, 21STRAT“Tip for all tasks: What is higher, orange orblue? First say it out loud, then you do!”“Tip for all tasks: First think and provide anestimate, then set the bars' correct height!”“Tip for all tasks: If the task is hard and you'restuck, what might help is to discuss and talk!”VERB“Explain to your learning partner: What didone need to do in order to solve the task?”“Describe to your learning partner: Whatcould one learn in this task?”“Explain to your learning partner: What do allof these tasks have in common?”Pre- and post- questionnaires and math tests were applied. The pre-questionnaire collected sociodemographic data, previous experiences with multi-touch devices, and attitudes towards math, school, andcollaborative learning. The post-questionnaire measured participants’ acceptance of the app, subjective learninggain, and aspects of the collaboration. The math test consisted of tasks related to fractions and proportions; thetasks were classified as requiring lower vs. higher levels of transfer (near transfer tasks vs. far transfer tasks). Thenear transfer tasks were designed to capture the strategies that were used to progress within Proportion. The fartransfer tasks aimed at capturing knowledge on proportions and fractions more broadly. At maximum, one couldreach 21 points in the math test: 13 for the far transfer tasks and 8 for the near transfer tasks.(a)(b)(c)(d)Figure 1.

Video cameras and microphonesrecorded participants’ interactions with each other and Proportion.CSCL 2017 Proceedings11© ISLSExperimental procedureThe experimental procedure followed a pre-test – intervention – post-test design and has been carried out by oneof several trained experimenters. Experiments took place inside the respective schools. Participants were randomlyassigned to conditions by lot. After a general welcoming and introduction to the learning session, the participantsindividually filled in the pre-questionnaire and the pre- math test (10 minutes). Next, the students workedcollaboratively with the Proportion app for 40 minutes, see figure 1d; this phase was video-taped. After a 5 minutesbreak, the participants individually filled in the post-questionnaire and post- math test (10 minutes). Altogether,one experiment cycle covered about two regular school lessons (90 minutes).VariablesThe dependent variables have been aggregated (i.e. averaged) on the dyad level as we cannot assume statisticalindependence of the dyadic learners. Regarding the analysis of learners’ non-verbal behavior and dialogues, wechose to sample every second problem of every second of the up to 21 levels learners reached in the given 40minutes. This allowed us to focus on continuous interactions (reactions to success, reactions to the prompts forthe prompted conditions, and the problem solving process) on typical tasks throughout the learning experiencerather than special cases of initial coordination or final conclusions. The samples started with the appearance of“Correct” of the first problem of the level, covered the prompt, extended over the second problem and ended whenthis problem has been solved. The video samples have been transcribed and video coded using coding schemesthat have been developed based on previous work (e.g., Weinberger & Fischer, 2006) and the data at hand.Interrater reliability was measured using Krippendorff’s α. Dependent variables analyzed for this contributioncomprise task focus (measured as off-task behavior), negative and positive emotions (gestures), transactivity andepistemic quality, and learning gains in near and far transfer tasks (math-tests). Instances of off-task behavior,positive and negative emotions have each been summed up and their average occurrence per coded segment hasbeen calculated, see table 2 for the coding criteria.Table 2: Coding criteria for nonverbal behavior (video analysis)VariableOff-taskbehaviorPositiveemotionsNegativeemotionsKrippendorff’s α.95.81.77Indicatorslooking around the classroom, looking into the camera, interactions withparticipants outside the own groupclapping into one’s own or the learning partner’s hands, throwing hands up in theair, clenching the fist, showing thumbs-upthreatening the iPad, facing the palms upwards, dismissive hand gesture, facepalmingRegarding the transcripts of dialogues, the utterance / turn was the unit of analysis and one category hasbeen assigned to each. Transactivity refers to the extent that participants react to and base their verbal contributionson their partners’ contributions. Epistemic quality refers to the content of participants’ utterances: Are theutterances off- or on-topic and are they a pure regulation of their interaction or (different levels) of actual taskrelated explanations?Table 3: Coding criteria for transactivity and epistemic quality (transcripts of videos)VariableKrippendorff’s αTransactivity.78Epistemicquality.90CSCL 2017 ProceedingsCategoriesExternalizationExternalization as reactionAcceptanceRefusalElicitationIntegrationConflict-oriented consensus buildingOff-topic utteranceOn-topic: regulation of the interactionOn-topic: concrete task-related regulationOn-topic: abstract content-related regulationOn-topic: Strategies / procedural knowledge12Relative quality001124800148© ISLSTo illustrate the coding scheme, here is one example from the data: Student A: “This needs to go higher”,student B: “You have to go lower. It needs to be three times the size”. Regarding transactivity, we codedexternalization for student A, and conflict-oriented consensus building for student B, as student B refutes thepartner’s suggestion, but also provides an alternative suggestion and justifies it. Regarding epistemic quality, wecoded concrete task-related regulation for student A, because the remark is closely tied to what can be seen on thescreen, and we coded abstract content-related regulation for student B, because the remark refers to more abstractknowledge (“three times the size”), going beyond what can be seen on the screen. Taking their relative qualityinto account (see e.g., Teasley, 1997; Weinberger & Fischer, 2006), the raw categories of transactivity andepistemic quality, see table 3, have each been aggregated to global scores.Resultsaverage number ofeventsHypothesis 1 stated a main effect for both STRAT and VERB as well as an interaction between the prompts ontask focus. A two-factorial ANOVA revealed no statistically significant main effect of STRAT (F(1,76)=.159,p=.691), but a highly significant main effect of VERB: F(1,76)=18.190, p=.000, η²=.19. However, this highlysignificant effect is contrary to our hypothesis, as off-task behavior is actually reinforced, and not reduced, withthe presence of the VERB prompt, see figure 2. The interaction of the prompts was not statistically significant(F(1,76)=2.451, p=.122).Hypothesis 2 stated more positive emotions for STRAT and more negative emotions for VERB. A twofactorial ANOVA revealed no statistically significant effect of STRAT on positive emotions: F(1,76)=1.919,p=.170. The effect of VERB on negative emotions is statistically significant with F(1,76)=7.019, p=.010, η²=.09,see figure 2.***2.01.51.00.50.01.41.10.70.5no VERBVERBoff-task eventsno STRATSTRAT**0.2 0.30.3 0.4no VERBVERBpositive emotions0.20.10.3 0.3no VERBVERBnegative emotionsFigure 2.

Two-factorial ANOVAs were conducted. Regarding transactivity, there was asignificant main effect of VERB (F(1,70)=7.241, p=.009, η²=.094), indicating higher transactivity in the presenceof the VERB prompts than without it, see figure 3a. Also regarding the epistemic quality score, there was asignificant main effect of VERB (F(1,70)=9.437, p=.003, η²=.119), indicating a higher epistemic quality in thepresence of the VERB prompts than without it, see figure 3b.CSCL 2017 Proceedings13© ISLS6040STRATepistemic qualitytransactivityno STRAT**47.029.223.735.5200no VERB302012.012.9STRAT21.618.3100VERBno STRAT**no VERBVERB(a)(b)Figure 3.

Two-factorial repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted. Regarding neartransfer tasks, there was no statistically significant interaction of STRAT × point in time (F(1,77)=.585, p=.447),VERB × point in time (F(1,77)=.061, p=.805) or STRAT × VERB × point in time (F(1,77)=1.502, p=.224). Onlyan improvement independent from conditions could be found (main effect of point in time): F(1,77)=11.179,p=.001, η²=.13. Regarding far transfer tasks, there was no statistically significant interaction of STRAT × pointin time (F(1,77)=3.231, p=.076), VERB × point in time (F(1,77)=.112, p=.739) or STRAT × VERB × point intime (F(1,77)=.003, p=.953). Contrary to near transfer tasks, no generic improvement from pre- to post-test (maineffect of point in time) in the far transfer tasks could be found: F(1,77)=.174, p=.677.DiscussionCollaborative learning with a shared multi-touch device might enable young learners to bodily experiencemathematical properties. The learning experiences may be enhanced by different ways of scaffolding, which isbeing investigated in this study.Hypothesis 1 claimed a main effect on task focus for the strategy prompts, the verbalization prompts aswell as their combination. While the strategy prompts did not have a statistically significant effect on task focus,the verbalization prompts’ influence was strong but reverse to our hypothesis: The verbalization prompts actuallyincreased off-task behavior. An interaction effect of the prompts on task focused behavior could not be found.Hypothesis 1 needs to be rejected. On one hand, the strategy prompts could not measurably help learners to stayon track, on the other hand, while we intended to direct learners’ attention to relevant aspects of the task with theverbalization prompts, we actually achieved the opposite: Learners got distracted more easily.Those results get solidified when looking at hypothesis 2 which predicted more positive emotions as aconsequence of the strategy prompts and more negative emotions as a consequence of the verbalization prompts.Again, presence of the strategy prompts did not make a difference regarding positive emotions; possibly, anyprompt, even if it is there to help learners, might be unwelcome in an embodied learning environment, as it disruptsthe ongoing immersive activities. As hypothesized, the verbalization prompts induced more negative emotions,which may be linked to an increase in perceived task difficulty. Hypothesis 2 is being rejected concerning positiveemotions affected by the strategy prompts, but confirmed regarding negative emotions affected by theverbalization prompts. Taken together with the results of hypothesis 1 (verbalization prompts increase off-taskbehavior) those results are disconcerting. Participants being confronted with the verbalization prompts showedabout twice as much negative emotions and off-task behavior as participants without it. There seems to be a thinline between enriching a game-like learning environment in a way that facilitates learning, while keeping students’engagement high (Deater-Deckard, El Mallah, Chang, Evans, & Norton, 2014). However helpful prompts like“Explain to your learning partner…” have proven to be in the past, they may still come at the cost of raising thedifficulty too much, interrupting the flow, and disengaging learners in specific immersive, embodied CSCLexperiences. Hence, these results merit further investigation of when, how, and why prompting may produce theseproblematic side effects.Hypothesis 3 predicted higher levels of transactivity and higher epistemic quality caused by theverbalization prompts. Indeed, this could be confirmed. Verbalization prompts had positive medium-sized effectson students’ dialogues on both, transactivity as well as epistemic quality. Similar findings have already beenestablished with adult learners, e.g. showing positive effects of scripting on argumentation (Weinberger,CSCL 2017 Proceedings14© ISLSStegmann, & Fischer, 2010). Here we can show that prompts can raise discussion quality even with young learners(see also van Dijk, Gijlers, & Weinberger, 2014).Hypothesis 4 claimed that strategy prompts and verbalization prompts and their combination will resultin higher learning gains. Only for near transfer tasks, a medium-to-large statistically significant improvement frompre- to post- math test over all conditions could be found. There was no interaction with any of the prompts, therewas also no significant improvement regarding the far transfer tasks.The strategy prompts were widely ineffectual. We could not find support for the assumption that theywould actually make the task easier. Motivational as well as cognitive factors could have played a role. We couldnot force participants to thoroughly read the prompts and in the light of the engaging and fun gaming activity, theprompts might have simply been ignored and the gaming activity continued instead. Also, limited cognitivecapacities in processing, understanding and applying the suggested strategies might account for the limited effectsof the strategy prompts.The verbalization prompts impacted many variables, in beneficial and detrimental ways. They showedto enhance quality of talk, not to affect learning gain, and to have adverse effects on task focus and negativeemotions, presumably having raised the difficulty (too much). Since the verbalization prompts did augment qualityof learners’ talk (see results of hypotheses 3), a positive effect on learning could have been expected. Differentalternative explanations may apply why that was not the case. Verbalization of difficult to verbalize cognitiverepresentations can corrupt performance in non-verbal tasks (verbal overshadowing effect; Schooler, 2002). Also,social preference might have played a role: Van Dijk et al. (2014) found that social aspects are crucial in younglearners’ collaborative learning, i.e. students who got along well with each other produced better results. In ourstudy, the dyad formation was random, so maybe that is why participants did not always collaborate effectively.Regarding the topical embodiment perspective, however, our study does not find much support for embodimentto be a huge factor in learning. Likewise, limited effects of game-based learning environments have been attributedto the sole acquisition of intuitive knowledge that is never verbalized and translated to out-of-game contexts likeformal tests (Wouters et al., 2015). More studies comparing Proportion to a comparable learning environment thatdoes not feature embodied approaches could firstly, shed more light on the actual role of embodiment in learningand secondly, inspire the development of new learning environments that sensibly bring together embodied,hands-on learning experiences with phases of activities that serve abstraction and reflection.In this study, we investigated how prompting for strategic behavior and/or reflective dialogue effectscollaborative learning of proportional reasoning in an intuitive, embodied learning environment. Challenges ofincorporating phases of reflection into bodily learning environments while keeping flow and engagement highhave been highlighted. Future research could focus on how to further address this issue.ReferencesAbrahamson, D., & Lindgren, R. (2014). Embodiment and embodied design. In R. K.
