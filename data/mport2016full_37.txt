How Socio-Cognitive Information Affects Individual StudyDecisionsLenka Schnaubert, University of Duisburg-Essen, lenka.schnaubert@uni-due.deDaniel Bodemer, University of Duisburg-Essen, bodemer@uni-due.deAbstract: Metacognitive self-regulation theories assume that individual monitoring guidesstudy decisions. However, self-regulated online learning is not done in isolation and inherentlysocial. Group awareness research suggests that socio-cognitive information may be a strongasset to collaborative and individual learning. Integrating individual research traditions into asocial setting, our experimental study (N = 61) investigates how visualizing socio-cognitiveinformation influences core individual learning processes, especially the search for information,the learners’ self-evaluations of knowledge and learning outcomes. While on the surface studybehaviour seemed not to be affected by the availability of socio-cognitive information, moreprofound analyses revealed that learners provided with partner information did rely less heavilyon initial self-evaluations, but adapted their evaluations and focused more on the partnerinformation provided. Knowledge gain was not affected. In conclusion, social context can bean important factor in self-regulation emphasizing that individual and collaborative researchtraditions may complement each other.IntroductionOpen learning environments offer the opportunity for students to choose when and what to learn and how to searchfor what information, in short: to make important study decisions. Consequently, it is no surprise that research onself-regulated learning in online education increased tremendously in the last years (Tsai, Shen, & Fan, 2013).But online learning is not only self-directed, but also social by nature (Shea & Bidjerano, 2010). With a growingbody of web-technology and more and more information available online, self-regulated learning is not done inenclosed spaces and, maybe more importantly, not done in isolation. Further, regulated learning is inherentlysocial, because regulating learning means interacting with an environmental and social context (Järvelä &Hadwin, 2013). Learners may encounter differing opinions challenging the learners’ knowledge and creatingsocio-cognitive conflicts, thus initiating further learning processes. Consequently, we can assume that selfregulated learning is severely influenced by its social context. In collaborative research, social context informationis seen as a key prerequisite of meaningful social interaction and thus frequently visualized via (cognitive) groupawareness tools which explicitly focus on providing socio-cognitive information, i.e. information on otherlearners’ cognitions, to foster individual as well as collaborative learning processes and outcomes (Janssen &Bodemer, 2013). Integrating individual research traditions in a social setting, our study investigates howvisualizing socio-cognitive information influences core individual learning processes, especially the search forinformation, learners’ self-evaluation of knowledge, and learning outcomes.BackgroundMetacognitive research suggests that self-regulated learners use their monitoring outcomes to guide their studydecisions (Nelson & Narens, 1990). One thoroughly researched metacognitive concept is the individualconfidence in one’s knowledge or answers, which might act as a sensor for the need to re-study material (Thiede,Anderson, & Therriault, 2003) or influence how much time is spent on it (Dunlosky & Ariel, 2011). It can alsosupport learners in prioritizing and sequencing their learning processes, which is especially important with timeconstraints (Son & Sethi, 2006). While this usually works well for good self-regulated learners, it relies heavilyon the individual skills to monitor the learning progress or outcome (Thiede, 1999). Unfortunately, research alsosuggests that learners are often overconfident with regard to their knowledge (Pressley, Ghatala, Woloshyn, &Pirie, 1990). This might hamper learning progress due to ineffective study decisions, e.g., learners might feelconfident about their knowledge and stop studying early even though they would have needed further study trialsto reach their goals (Dunlosky & Rawson, 2012).There are a number of external sources to inform self-evaluation processes. For example, externalevaluations of learning operations or products provided by experts may help to adjust learning strategies and / ormonitoring judgments (Butler & Winne, 1995). Conversely, metacognitive judgments also influence the waylearners perceive and use externally provided information (Kulhavy & Stock, 1989). Confidence has been shownto influence feedback processing, as well as feedback effects (Butterfield & Metcalfe, 2006). One prevalent theoryICLS 2016 Proceedings274© ISLSis that unexpected feedback (pointing out errors committed with high confidence) motivates deeper elaborationof the feedback message and thus improves learning outcomes (Fazio & Marsh, 2009).Another source of information informing the individual self-evaluative system is a community or group.Information from large as well as small learning communities may help learners to re-evaluate or even validate(falsify or verify) their knowledge. In collaborative settings, but also in individual online learning, learners mayencounter competing and maybe even conflicting opinions of other learners. Comparing one’s own knowledgewith other learners’ externalized knowledge related information can be a strong asset to learning, thus makingcomparability a key feature of group awareness tools (Bodemer, 2011). Being confronted with opposing points ofview constitutes socio-cognitive conflict (Bell, Grossen, & Perret-Clermont, 1985). Within collaborative learningscenarios, socio-cognitive conflicts have been shown to foster learning processes and outcomes (Bodemer, 2011;Johnson & Johnson, 2009; Mugny & Doise, 1978), at least for epistemic conflicts (Darnon, Doll, & Butera, 2007).They are seen as an important motor for collaborative as well as individual learning (Mugny & Doise, 1978). Ifconfronted with conflicting information about the learning subject, the learners own hypotheses are challengedand they are obliged to explain and maybe even defend or backup their position (Johnson & Johnson, 2009) orintegrate the differing views (Darnon et al., 2007). Moreover, conceptual conflict has been shown to foster anactive search for information due to an increase in epistemic curiosity (Lowry & Johnson, 1981). Within thecontext of self-regulated learning, cognitive conflicts suggest re-evaluations of one’s own cognitions, e.g., theymay introduce uncertainty (Buchs, Butera, Mugny, & Darnon, 2004). As a consequence, learners should be proneto initiate search processes to come to a satisfying solution, e.g., to validate one position (Buchs et al., 2004), butthis might depend on the interplay of self- and partner-evaluations (Mugny, Butera, Sanchez-Mazas, & Perez,1995).While research done in these areas highly suggests that socio-cognitive information alters individuallearning processes (e.g., search processes), existing studies only sparsely integrate individual research traditionson metacognitive self-regulation into a social or even collaborative perspective. Contributing in closing this gap,we investigated if and how individual study decisions during self-regulated learning (especially the search forinformation) are affected by socio-cognitive information about another learner. Thereby we focussed on theinterplay of three potentially relevant variables: the individuals’ self-evaluation of knowledge (own confidence),the other learners’ self-evaluation (partner confidence) and their conflict status (does the partners’ knowledgechallenge (conflict) or support (consent) own knowledge). The following research questions were addressed:1. How does the presence of partner information change the selection of additional information?2. Does the presence of partner information change cognitive or metacognitive learning outcomes?3. How do learners take their own confidence, the partners’ confidence as well as the partners’ answers incomparison to own answers (conflict status) into account when selecting additional information?MethodsThe study took place in early summer (May – June) 2014. Data was assessed in the course of a Bachelor’s Thesis(Geerdes, 2014). 63 participants took part in the experiment, from which two had to be excluded due to computerfailure, which left us with N = 61 participants included in our sample. They were all university students, mainlyenrolled in a BA or MA course on Applied Cognitive and Media Science (47 female, 14 male). Their age rangedfrom 18 to 28 years with a mean age of 21.53 (SD = 2.09). All experiments were conducted in our research lab;instructions and materials were given via computer. Learners were randomly assigned to one of two researchconditions: with and without socio-cognitive partner information available during learning.Material and procedureAfter welcoming and declaration of consent, the participants received some information about the procedure ofthe experiment and filled out a demographics questionnaire assessing age, sex, and university course. Then theywere all presented with a 970-words text on immunology (adapted from material used in a study of Dehler,Bodemer, Buder, and Hesse, 2011, slightly shortened and re-written) and instructed to read the text carefully forup to 20 minutes. When they had finished, they were asked to answer 20 learning tasks, each consisting of astatement they were asked to judge as being true or false (cf. Figure 1). In addition, they were asked to give aconfidence rating for each answer by stating on a binary scale if they were sure or unsure that their answer wascorrect. The answer was spatially coded (true: top, false: bottom), the confidence was color-coded (highconfidence: filled-green, low confidence: hatched white-green) (cf. Figure 1). Afterwards, they were againpresented with these 20 tasks as well as their answers and confidence ratings and were given up to 15 minutes torequest and study additional information on as many tasks as they wanted to by clicking on a respective buttonprovided for each task. They were also able to change their answers and/or confidence ratings. While learnersICLS 2016 Proceedings275© ISLSwithout partner information (no partner information condition) received only their own answers and confidenceratings, learners with partner information (partner information condition) additionally received bogus partnerinformation generated by a fixed algorithm, which ensured that partner information was roughly balanced withregard to conflict status and partner confidence for each confidence level (ignoring the validity of the answers).After this second learning phase, participants were all asked to answer the learning tasks again from scratch,including confidence ratings. Finally, they took a knowledge test consisting of 19 questions (four options, singlechoice format), which assessed the learned concepts more deeply. Again, confidence in each answer was assessed,this time on a six-point Likert scale ranging from “not sure at all” (0) to “absolutely sure” (5).Figure 1. Examples of learning tasks and confidence ratings with (left) and without (right) partner information.Dependent variablesIn order to answer our research questions, we assessed how many and which additional information the learnersrequested during the second learning phase and in what order and how long they studied the information. To findout if information requests coincided with (low) confidence ratings, we computed within-subject correlations (amethod used in metacognition research to describe regulation of study, cf. Thiede, 1999; Thiede et al., 2003). Forthe partner information condition, we also computed a correlation index between conflict status and informationrequests to capture its influence on learning behaviour. To better understand the interplay between ownconfidence, partner confidence and conflict status (resulting from a comparison between own and partner answers)on their influence on information requests, we assessed the percentage of information requests for eachconstellation for the partner information condition. Moreover, we assessed performance and confidence levels inthe learning tasks and in the knowledge test by counting correctly solved or confident answers and computed amean confidence for the post test. We assessed relative monitoring accuracy in the form of within-subject phi- orgamma coefficients for each participant (cf. Schraw, Kuch, & Gutierrez, 2013). To analyze the sequence ofinformation requests in conjunction with information on individual confidence (both conditions), partnerconfidence and conflict status (partner information condition only), we ranked the information requests in orderof first appearance and computed a mean rank per person for each value (e.g., low) of each variable (e.g.,confidence). To eliminate the influence the number of appearances of each value has on its mean rank (mean rankincreases automatically with the number of appearances regardless of selection strategy), we computed mean rankdifferenceswithineachbinaryvariableinsteadofusingtheindividualvalues(e.g., [mean_rankHighConfidence – mean_rankLowConfidence]). The magnitude of the resulting figure informs about theextent learners give timewise priority to one value before the other, the algebraic sign tells us which one it is.FindingsHow does partner information change the selection of additional information?To analyse and compare the selection of additional material, we matched the answering patterns of the learners(and their bogus learning partner) with the event of selecting additional information. To compare the selectionagendas of the two experimental conditions, we first counted to how many tasks the learners in each grouprequested additional information and for how long they studied each one (cf. table 1). t-tests for independentsamples showed no significant differences between the groups for neither the number of information requests(t(59) = 0.50, p = .619, d = 0.13) nor the mean study duration per request (t(59) = 0.11, p = .914, d = 0.03).In a second step, we analyzed if the availability of partner information changed how learners chose theinformation to study. Without partner information 79.59% (SD = 21.05) of the information requested regardeditems answered with low confidence, while with partner information it was only 63.78% (SD = 23.17). Thisdifference was statistically significant (t(59) = 2.78; p = .007, d = 0.72). To further evaluate if learners really usetheir own confidence ratings to choose additional information, but also to see if conflicting opinions mightinfluence these decisions, we computed within-subject correlations between the initial level of individualICLS 2016 Proceedings276© ISLSconfidence (high vs. low) or the conflict status (presence or absence of conflict) and the presence or absence of arequest for information to each task, resulting in individual within-learner phi-coefficients (cf. table 1). t-tests onone sample confirmed a significant positive mean relation index between (lack of) confidence and informationrequests for the no partner information (t(27) = 9.45, p < .001, d = 1.77) as well as the partner informationcondition (t(29) = 5.55, p < .001, d = 1.00) and a positive relation between conflict and information requests inthe partner information condition (t(29) = 5.90, p < .001, d = 1.09). t-tests for independent samples showed thatmean phi-coefficients between confidence and information requests differed significantly between the twoconditions, with the no partner information condition having significantly higher coefficients than the partnerinformation condition (t(56) = 2.67, p = .010, d = 0.71), meaning that confidence ratings were more stronglyrelated to information requests if partner information was not available. A t-test for dependent samples comparingthe phi-coefficient within the partner information condition (own confidence vs. conflicts) showed no difference,meaning neither own confidence nor conflict status was more strongly related to information requests than theother (t(29) = 0.29, p = .774, d = 0.05).Table 1: Descriptive statistics on dependent variablesnpartner informationavailablenot availableMSDnMSDNoverallMSDoverall study behavior…number of information requests32 11.81 4.48 29 12.38 4.35 61 12.08 4.39…study duration per information (in seconds)32 14.58 8.68 29 14.36 7.32 61 14.48 8.00regulation of study / within-subject phi-coefficient(*)(**)…between information requests and own confidence 30.35.35 28.59.33 58.47.36…between information requests and conflict status30.33.30------performance / number of correctly solved items…in knowledge test32 5.03 2.07 29 5.07 1.60 61 5.05 1.85…in learning tasks pre32 13.13 2.06 29 13.38 2.03 61 13.25 2.03…in learning tasks post32 15.13 1.91 29 15.45 1.68 61 15.28 1.80confidence level…in knowledge test (mean confidence level)32 2.02 0.82 29 2.01 0.85 61 2.02 0.82…in learning tasks pre (number of certain items)32 9.91 3.60 29 9.62 3.13 61 9.77 3.36…in learning tasks post (number of certain items)32 14.50 3.52 29 15.86 2.80 61 15.15 3.25monitoring accuracy…knowledge test (gamma-coefficients)32.21.45 29.07.42 61.14.44…learning tasks pre (phi-coefficients)32.20.22 29.11.25 61.15.24…learning tasks post (phi-coefficients)(*)31.26.23 26.22.30 57.24.26sequencing of study process / mean rank differences(***)…own confidence32 2.20 3.45 29 3.63 4.02 61 2.88 3.77…conflict status32 3.96 3.02 ------…partner confidence32 0.03 1.45 ------(* )due to invariability of one factor, no correlation indices could be computed for some participants(**)positive values indicate that additional information was requested mainly to uncertain answers / conflicts(***)positive values indicate that uncertain / partner uncertain / conflicting items were considered firstDoes partner information change cognitive and metacognitive learning outcomes?In order to find out if the presence of partner information influences learning outcomes, we compared how manylearning tasks the learners were able to solve correctly pre and post learning and how many items they were ableto solve correctly in the knowledge test (cf. table 1). A t-Test for independent samples showed no significantgroup differences in the knowledge test (t(59) = 0.08, p = .937, d = 0.02). Please note that performance in bothgroups was just beyond chance, indicating high test difficulty. A two-factorial ANOVA with repeated measureson the learners performance in the learning tasks showed a significant main effect of time (F(1, 59) = 56.32,p < .001, ηp2 = .49) with the learners getting better from pre to post, but neither a significant main effect ofcondition (F(1, 59) = 0.49, p = .488, ηp2 = .01), nor an interaction (F(1, 59) = 0.02, p = .899, ηp2 < .001).To see if partner information does rattle individual confidence and if being confronted with potentiallyconflicting information does enhance self-evaluation processes, we compared individual confidence levels as wellas monitoring accuracy. We first compared how many learning tasks the learners solved confidently pre and postlearning and how mean confidence differed between the groups in the knowledge test (cf. table 1). t-tests showedno difference in confidence levels in the knowledge test (t(59) = 0.06, p = .954, d = 0.02). In the learning tasks,ICLS 2016 Proceedings277© ISLSthere was a significant effect of time with learners becoming more confident from pre to post (F(1, 59) = 219.06,p < .001, ηp2 = .79) and a significant interaction between time and condition (F(1, 59) = 5.07, p = .028, ηp2 = .08)with the confidence levels of learners with partner information not rising as much as without partner informationfrom pre to post. There was no main effect of condition (F(1, 59) = 0.50, p = .482, ηp2 = .01). Subsequently, wecompared monitoring accuracy again with regard to the learning tasks pre and post learning (within-subject phicoefficients between confidence and performance) and the post-test (within-subject gamma-coefficients betweenconfidence and performance). Descriptive statistics are available in table 1. We conducted a Mann-Whitney-Test(due to violations of the normality assumption) to compare the gamma-coefficients between the groups, but foundno significant differences (U = 558.50, Z = 1.37 p = .172, r = .17). Accuracy on the learning tasks showed amarginally significant effect of time (F(1, 55) = 3.49, p = .067, ηp2 = .06), but neither an effect of condition(F(1, 55) = 1.73, p = .194, ηp2 = .03), nor an interaction (F(1, 55) = 0.26, p = .611, ηp2 = .01). It is worthmentioning that the correlation-coefficients were quite low in general indicating a weak linkage between selfevaluation and performance (low monitoring accuracy).How do learners consider own and partner information when requesting information?To investigate how learners take their own confidence, their partner’s answer as well as confidence into accountwhen choosing where and when they need additional information, we first focussed on the partner informationcondition and computed which answer patterns led to requests for additional information. Table 2 visualizes eachpattern as well as the mean percentage (and standard deviation) of information requests.Table 2: Mean information request percentage per answer pattern (partner information condition, n = 28(*))conflictself uncertainpartnerpartneruncertaincertainM = 91.96SD = 23.07(*) dueM = 78.87SD = 36.04consensusself certainpartnerpartneruncertaincertainM = 51.49SD = 36.43self uncertainpartnerpartneruncertaincertainM = 65.77SD = 34.79M = 73.21SD = 36.67M = 65.48SD = 43.49self certainpartnerpartneruncertaincertainM = 25.00SD = 35.57M = 16.96SD = 33.37to highly unbalanced confidence ratings which did not allow for all constellations, four learners had to be excludedWe computed an ANOVA with our three binary within-subject independent variables describing eachpattern (own confidence: high vs. low, partner’s confidence: high vs. low, partner’s answer: conflicting vs.consenting) and measured the impact on the actual percentage of information requests following eachconstellation (cf. table 3). Figure 2 illustrates the three-way interaction. Please note that the data was heavilyskewed and not normally distributed. We used parametric tests, because methods to model multi-factorial nonparametrical data are scarce. Thus, the results of the inferential analysis should be treated with caution.Table 3: Results of ANOVA regarding effects of within-subject variables on information request percentageEffectmain effect1st order interaction2nd order interactionIndependent Variable(s)conflictconfidencepartner confidenceconflict * confidenceconflict * partner confidenceconfidence * partner confidenceconflict * confidence * partner confidenceF22.0437.381.6913.302.495.016.09df11111111df227272727272727p<.001<.001.205.001.126.034.020η p2.45.58.06.33.08.16.18As also observed while studying the phi-correlations regarding the first research question, these resultsstrengthen the assumption that confidence as well as conflicts are highly responsible for information requests.Further, the results indicate that they interact in doing so. Looking at the plots in Figure 2, it seems that individualconfidence matters more, if there is an agreement between learning partners and less, when there are conflictingopinions involved. In contrast, the statistically significant interaction between own and partner confidence oncloser inspection seems to be explained by the second order interaction, thus we abstain from interpreting it, butfocus on the second order interaction: in case of consenting opinions, partner confidence does not seem to impactinformation requests – the only information relevant is individual confidence. In the conflict case this is veryICLS 2016 Proceedings278© ISLSdifferent. Here, both confidence variables seem to interact. While conflicts with unsure partner and a sure selftriggered the least information request (an unsure partner disagreeing might not be regarded as relevant), a conflictwith both partners unsure triggered the most. If the partner is sure of him/herself, the own confidence does notseem to matter too much – information request rate is quite high in both cases.Figure 2. Three-way interaction effect (confidence, conflict status, partner confidence) on information requests.In a second step we conducted sequential analyses to assess the order of proceeding for the learners ineach group. We computed mean rank differences for every variable of interest (procedure described above) tocalculate, if learners give precedence to a specific value, e.g., if they consider items with conflicting opinionsbefore considering items with consenting opinions (cf. table 1). t-tests on one sample show that own confidence(t(31) = 3.60, p = .001, d = 0.64) as well as conflict status (t(31) = 7.41, p < .001, d = 1.31) influenced the orderlearners in the partner information group requested information –the mean rank differences differed significantlyfrom chance– but partner confidence didn’t (t(31) = 0.10, p = .918, d = 0.02). For the no partner informationgroup, Wilcoxon signed-rank test (due to violation of the normality assumption) confirmed a similar effect forindividual confidence (Z = 3.67, p < .001, r = .68). Taking the direction into account, learners requestedinformation on items they were uncertain about or conflicting items earlier than on items answered with certaintyor consenting items. A Mann-Whitney-Test between the conditions showed a marginal effect of condition on themean rank difference for the (own) confidence dimension (U = 593.50, Z = 1.87, p = .061, r = .24), hinting thatmaybe the partner information condition used own confidence slightly less than the no partner informationcondition. Within the partner information condition we additionally compared the mean rank differences for thethree dimensions own confidence, partner confidence and conflict status with t-tests for dependent samples to seewhich variable showed most influential with regard to order of processing. The results showed that the effect ofconflict status was significantly greater than that of own confidence (t(31) = 2.09, p = .045, d = 0.34) or partnerconfidence (t(31) = 6.95, p < .001, d = 1.23). Mean rank difference for own confidence was significantly greaterthan for partner confidence (t(31) = 3.31, p = .002, d = 0.59).Conclusions and implicationsOur study aimed at describing how the presence of socio-cognitive information influences individual learningprocesses – even without the chance to communicate, collaborate or interact with the partner. More precisely, welooked at how partner information (information about knowledge and knowledge evaluations of a potentiallearning partner) influences the individual search for information and learning outcomes. We expected learnerswith partner information to access more information and study it longer motivated by the presence of conflictingopinions, but they didn’t. Differing opinions might not have the same potentially surprising effect as externalfeedback, if its origin is unknown (Mugny et al., 1995). Additionally, learning outcomes were not affected by thepresence of partner information, but it influenced self-evaluations – although not greatly. As expected, theconfidence of learners with partner information available was rattled, presumably by conflicting opinions aboutthe correctness of answers (Buchs et al., 2004), but unfortunately this was independent of performance – if aproper re-evaluation took place, it failed to enhance monitoring accuracy. Even more, this increase in uncertaintydid not lead to an increase in study behaviour (e.g., number of information requests or duration of study), but itdid change its focus: While in the absence of information on learning partners learners based their study decisions(what to study when) heavily on individual confidence (as frequently reported in self-regulation research, e.g.,Thiede, 1999; Thiede et al., 2003), with information on a potential learning partner present, the situation becamemore complex. Analysing the individual relation between information requests and confidence and conflicts wefound that without partner information, own confidence was the main influential factor, with partner informationit became less so, with conflicts becoming more important. Timewise, conflicting opinions seemed to capture theICLS 2016 Proceedings279© ISLSlearners’ attention resulting in slightly higher mean rank differences for the conflict dimension than for theconfidence dimension and it also seemed to lessen the effect own confidence had on the search for information asgroup comparisons indicated (although this difference was not statistically significant). There exist differentmodels on how learners allocate study time and choose and prioritize information to study, mainly resulting froma discrepancy reduction model (Dunlosky & Hertzog, 1998) or a region of proximal learning approach (Metcalfe,2009), with task constraints (Son & Sethi, 2006) and personal agendas (Ariel, Dunlosky, & Bailey, 2009) beingimportant influential factors. Further studies should conduct more profound analyses in this area to broaden thisexisting research on individual self-regulation by integrating social scenarios. In our study, learners werereasonably free to select any information and they not only attended to conflicts or uncertainly answered itemsfirst, they did so primarily. Three-way interactions confirmed that –as expected from research on socio-cognitiveconflicts (Lowry & Johnson, 1981)– conflicting opinions became a major influence on information search, whilepartner confidence had a somewhat unexpected effect: it was expected that the lower the partner confidence thelesser the experience of conflict and thus the lesser the search for information, but this was not the case. If thelearning partner agreed with the individuals’ opinion (consensus), information requests were solely based onindividual confidence, disregarding partner confidence. If conflicts occurred, partner confidence interacted withown confidence to influence information requests. We can conclude that learners do take into account how thepotential partners evaluate themselves, even though they are completely unknown. If they disagree and are sureof themselves, learners re-check their own information. If partners are uncertain about their answers, learners maystill question their own answers, but especially and much more so, if they are unsure anyway. The latter casemight indicate that maximum uncertainty (both uncertain) with conflicting opinions (no indication that any oneanswer is correct) changes our evaluation of the task, which might also lead to increased information search (adiscrepancy reduction approach might indicate the farthest group distance from getting the correct answer andthus the most reason to attend to the task).In conclusion, social context does seem to affect individual learning and we should reinforce our(theoretical and empirical) efforts to describe 21th century self-regulated learning as what it is – a communalprocess. Study decisions are strongly affected by the presence of socio-cognitive information. Focussing onrelevant information might be enhanced by the presence of others, but may also become more complicated asmore or unknown actors come into play. While this study was able to shed some light on how learners integrateknowledge of other’s opinions as well as their self-evaluations to make study decisions in a highly controlledexperimental setting, it was beyond the scope to analyse actual collaborative efforts. While we focussed on sociocognitive information as a source of information to foster individual study decisions, the next logical step wouldbe to explicitly integrate the notion of a learning partner as a source of further information – to interact, to ask, toexplain, to question, in short: into an inherently collaborative learning scenario. Even though research on groupawareness tools frequently incorporates socio-cognitive information into collaborative learning settings,combining it with metacognitive research by integrating self-evaluations of both partners as well as cognitiveinformation on content-knowledge and incorporating methods of both research traditions may be a strong asset toresearch on collaborative as well as individual self-regulated learning.ReferencesAriel, R., Dunlosky, J., & Bailey, H.
