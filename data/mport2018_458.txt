We study cognitive-affective relationships in high versus low performing students as they worked on a model building task to teach their agent in Betty’s Brain, anopen-ended science learning environment. Our initial results allow for some interesting discussions, but they also emphasize the need for fine grained affective data to match up against cognitive states to determine how they influence performance or vice versa.IntroductionSelf regulated learning (SRL) involves the temporal deployment of cognitive, affective, metacognitive, and motivational processes (Azevedo et al., 2012). SRL processes are important for successful science learning, especially in open-ended learning environments (OELEs). Related work in this area show that affect can impact cognitive behaviors like decision-making, information processing, and reasoning (Forgas et al., 2006). Previous results highlight the importance of measuring and studying the interactions of affect with students’ learning performance and behaviors. These findings help us understand that detecting and alleviating negative affect leads tobetter learning. This paper analyzes the interactions between components of SRL, primarily cognitive strategiesand affective states, in the Betty’s Brain OELE (Leelawong and Biswas, 2008).MethodsWe ran a study with 87 sixth-grade students in an urban public school in Nashville, TN, USA, who worked onmodeling the causes and effects of climate change in Betty’s Brain over four days. Students’ interactions in Betty’sBrain were logged. Two trained human observers (Cohen’s kappa, 𝜅𝜅 > 0.8) collected data on students’ affectivestates (bored, confused, delight, engaged concentration, frustrated, other), as well as their task behaviors (ontask, off-task, on-task conversation, other) following the Baker Rodrigo Ocumpaugh Monitoring Protocol(BROMP) for field observations (Ocumpaugh, Baker, & Rodrigo, 2015). We used differential sequence miningto identify frequent cognitive strategies that differed between high and low performing students (Kinnebrew etal., 2013). We then computed the differences in affect observed for high versus low performers, and therebystudied the relationships between cognitive strategies and on-task affective states.Results and discussionsWe applied the measure of students’ in-system performance, their map scores (𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 𝑣𝑣𝑚𝑚𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑚𝑚 = 11), to divideall the students (𝑚𝑚 = 87) into High (Hi) and Low (Lo) performers. Students with a map score greater than 11 werelabeled “Hi” (𝑚𝑚 = 44) and those with a map score less than 10 were labeled “Lo” (𝑚𝑚 = 39). Data for students atthe median value (𝑚𝑚 = 4) was discarded to maintain the distinction between the two groups. Next, we ran a differential sequential pattern mining algorithm (Kinnebrew et al., 2013) to identify the differentially frequent cognitive patterns between Hi and Lo performers. Table 1 presents 3 frequent cognitive strategies sorted by the difference in the two groups’ instance support values. The descriptors “-EFF/-INEFF” and “-SUP/-UNSUP” attachedto causal link edit actions show whether the actions were effectiveineffective (led to an increasedecrease in themap score) and supportedunsupported (relatedunrelated to previous actions), respectively.Table 1: Differentially frequent patterns for High vs Low performing studentsPatternREAD  LINKADD-EFF-SUP  QUIZQUIZ  READREAD  CONV-REQICLS 2018 Proceedingsi-Frequency Diff(Hi − Lo)2.14.35−0.471691s-FrequentGroupHiBOTHLo𝒑𝒑 value< 0.001< 0.0010.02© ISLSWe analyzed the data collected on affective states of the students by group (Hi and Lo performers). Wefound that the amount of time spent being bored was significantly higher for the Low performers (𝑝𝑝 = 0.002)when the learners were in on-task mode. On-task behavior was also naturally marked by significantly higher levelof delight (𝑝𝑝 = 0.015) for the Hi group. Next, we studied the affective states during use of the cognitive strategiesfrom Table 1 between Hi and Lo performing students. The results of these cognitive-affective interactions areillustrated in Figure 1.QuizRead, a frequently used pattern by all students, was linked to delight or frustration for the Hiperformers, versus boredom and confusion for the Lo performers. A possible interpretation of this result is that,seeing good quiz results or improvement in the results produces delight, whereas negative quiz results producefrustration in the Hi performers. Confusion and boredom in Lo performers can be attributed to not being able toanalyze the quiz results to find the information to read. However, frustration in high performers caused by thelack of immediate success did not seem to affect their desire to persist (unlike the low performers who got boredand gave up). Instead, frustration seemed to be channeled into reading activities that helped them find the information that they needed to correct their maps, and, therefore, they got past their frustrated state.ReadConv-Req is a differentially frequent pattern for Low performers. It includes a period of readingresource pages, but not understanding the content (or finding the desired information), therefore, seeking helpfrom the Mentor. This is good SRL behavior, however, the Lo group showed a lot of boredom during this period(implying their lack of success led them to disengage from productive work on system), while the Hi performersprimarily displayed confusion or frustration (unable to understand content, therefore, confusion or frustration, butthey seemed to follow up by seeking help in a productive way).Read LinkAdd-Eff-SupQuiz is differentially frequent in High performers. Here, the student read andconverted the information they read into correct causal links, and then took a quiz to verify if their added link wascorrect. For Lo performers, who performed this strategy rarely, no affect state was recorded (hence, their affectstates are not included in Figure 1). Hi performers displayed significant levels of delight during this period, indicating that they were happy because they updated the map correctly based on what they read in the resources, andthe quiz results confirmed that they had added correct link(s).Figure 1.

As a broader research goal, we believe that establishingcause-effect relations between cognitive and affective processes will help us construct more complete models togain an understanding of the relations between cognition, metacognition, and affect in SRL.ReferencesAzevedo, R., Behnagh, R.
