Using Vygotsky’s (1978) notion of play, we examine how two distinct AR environments—rule-based game play and open-ended modeling play—support 1st and 2nd graders’ inquiry (N=122) into how matter changes state at the level of microscopic particles. We further use the notion of keys (Goffman, 1974) to examine how the students construct distinct participation frameworks (Goodwin, 1993) within the two activity designs, and how this organization of activity may impact their learning experience. Our analyses show that students within a game-play environment were more oriented towards accomplishing a goal rather than understanding how a system works whereas those in the modeling-play group focused more explicitly on understanding mechanism and process.","Mahoney, Charlie",16,8,Mahoney C.

Furthermore, despite the fact that several studies describe important roles for teachers in constructing successful classroom learning experiences, only a few of them examine how teachers’ instructional practices, knowledge, and beliefs influence student learning outcomes and the extent to which teachers are interested and willing to teach through complex systems approaches. Furthermore, we do not know what supports teachers themselves say that they need to teach about complex systems in their classrooms. In this study, we present a curriculum and instruction framework that outlines how teaching and learning about complex systems in high school science classroom contexts can be done. We articulate the features of the framework and provide examples of how the framework is translated into practice. We follow with evidence from an exploratory study conducted with 10 teachers and over 300 students aimed at understanding change in teachers’ instructional practices; the extent to which students learned from the activities; what teachers’ perceptions were in terms of utility and usability; and what other supports teachers needed.

Furthermore, despite the fact that several studies describe important roles for teachers in constructing successful classroom learning experiences, only a few of them examine how teachers’ instructional practices, knowledge, and beliefs influence student learning outcomes and the extent to which teachers are interested and willing to teach through complex systems approaches. Furthermore, we do not know what supports teachers themselves say that they need to teach about complex systems in their classrooms. In this study, we present a curriculum and instruction framework that outlines how teaching and learning about complex systems in high school science classroom contexts can be done. We articulate the features of the framework and provide examples of how the framework is translated into practice. We follow with evidence from an exploratory study conducted with 10 teachers and over 300 students aimed at understanding change in teachers’ instructional practices; the extent to which students learned from the activities; what teachers’ perceptions were in terms of utility and usability; and what other supports teachers needed.

We present a set of seven studies that demonstrate the strong potential for the cross-fostering of ideas between educational scientists, who focus on the interventionist design-based study of learning, and social scientists, who focus on the analytic study of ambient social interaction and knowledge construction. Each study demonstrates specific insights regarding lessons that can be learned from the ambient to the designed arena, and vice versa, using lenses that integrate our various disciplinary research perspectives.

In contrast, work in learning analytics attempts to leverage the collection and analysis of data to improve learning processes and outcomes in-situ. Developing learning analytics to support CSCL thus offers the opportunity to make our research actionable in an immediate way by using data collected on collaborative processes in-progress to inform their future trajectories. Efforts in this direction are specifically promising in support of students’ self- and socially shared- regulation of their learning. Data on collaborative and metacognitive activities can inform collaborating groups and help them to improve future joint efforts. In this symposium we bring together a collection of five papers that are exploring the space of connection between CSCL, learning analytics and self-regulation to advance thinking around these issues.

We present a set of seven studies that demonstrate the strong potential for the cross-fostering of ideas between educational scientists, who focus on the interventionist design-based study of learning, and social scientists, who focus on the analytic study of ambient social interaction and knowledge construction.

Our data was collected in a dual eye-tracking setup where dyads of students (N=54) had to interact with a Tangible User Interface (TUI). We selected two groups of students displaying high levels of joint visual attention and compared them using cross-recurrence graphs displaying moments of joint attention from the eye-tracking data, speech data, and by qualitatively analyzing videos generated for that purpose. We found that greater insights can be found by augmenting cross-recurrence graphs with spatial and verbal data, and that high levels of joint visual attention can hide a free-rider effect (Salomon & Globerson, 1989). We conclude by discussing implications for automatically analyzing students’ interactions using dual eye-trackers.","Dillenbourg, Pierre",19,4,Dillenbourg P.

It complements agent-based models of systems by representing a micro-level individual’s properties, events and location, together with macro-level variables of the system. The study examines whether this perceptual compensation creates a comparable learning environment. Students who are blind worked with auditory models; sighted students used visual models. Conceptual understanding and systems reasoning were assessed with pre- and post-test questionnaires. Learning processes were captured by analyzing their workbook writings. The L2C environment not only supported blind students’ learning similarly, but also furthered their learning with one of the more challenging concepts, diffusion. Some concepts relating to the micro-level were learned earlier among the blind students.

By proposing the notion of “student-generated resources” (SGRs) and adopting a “resources use” rather than sociolinguistic perspective, this study investigates what SGRs are there in the classroom and how teachers process them. Based on classroom observations, we identify five types of SGRs. Following the “perceive–interpret–mobilize” processing flow, teachers demonstrate three processing results (utilize, feedback, and abandon). Further, we identify three approaches of teachers’ utilization of SGRs and five approaches of their feedback to SGRs. Our findings suggest that teachers tend to give feedback to SGRs rather than utilize them as resources. This study broadens theoretical landscape about classroom resources and helps teachers take full advantage of SGRs in empowering students’ learning.","Zheng, Tainian",14,4,Zheng T.

These four dyads were completing a design task we set them, while simultaneously learning how to make good use of the various personal and shared digital tools, display surfaces and other resources in the studio. From observational and interview data, we show how collaborative design for learning needs to be understood as a complex, multiply-situated activity, in which design problem-solving, tools and space usage depend on the fluent deployment of intuitive knowledge about mutual awareness, shared perception, information persistence and movement.

The results show that members of class A had more comprehensive and coherent awareness of the various inquiry themes discussed by their community focusing on deep conceptualization of electricity. Informed by the reflective awareness, classroom A also engaged in more active and connected online discourse to address deepening issues and develop coherent explanations across different lines of inquiry.

Moreover we also proposed a collaborative add on activity to the learning material for the students to help them reflect on the material they learnt in the MOOC video. What comes out of the present study is two different interaction styles that differentiate the good students from the poor students. The good students engage with the teacher/collaborating partner through the interface/display. While the poor students engage with the material only. We name these two interaction styles as “looking through” and “looking at” respectively.

Our interests are precisely in what ways the “tools” people employ in these studies mediate activities of learning and remembering, and how they contribute to the organization of collective forms of knowing. We also address how we analyze the specific material features of tools that co-determine the unfolding of the activities.

Despite growing awareness in the CSCL community of the importance of design in teachers’ work, there has been very little empirical research on how such design is carried out, or how design for CSCL can be supported and improved through the provision of better design tools and design methods. The paper offers an analysis of the work of four pairs of designers in our Multi-Surface Design Studio. These four dyads were completing a design task we set them, while simultaneously learning how to make good use of the various personal and shared digital tools, display surfaces and other resources in the studio. From observational and interview data, we show how collaborative design for learning needs to be understood as a complex, multiply-situated activity, in which design problem-solving, tools and space usage depend on the fluent deployment of intuitive knowledge about mutual awareness, shared perception, information persistence and movement.

Based on the approaches of voices interanimation and polyphony, a natural language processing tool was employed for dialog analysis in integrative vs. non-integrative blog-based OKCs. Three dialog dimensions were identified: participants’ individual content-oriented contribution, social contribution, and their position within the social network. Hierarchical clusters built upon these dimensions reflect socio-cognitive structures including central, regular and peripheral OKC members. OKCs with a stronger layer of regular members appear more likely to integrate new members, whereas OKCs with a stronger layer of peripheral members appear less likely to do so.

Yet, argumentation scripts run the danger of overscripting students’ argumentation. A possible solution might be to offer adaptable argumentation scripts that allow students to adjust the script to their own needs. This study compares the effects of three argumentation scripts (high structured vs. low structured vs. adaptable) on students’ argumentation skills. Furthermore, we investigate to what extent students’ self-regulation skills influence the acquisition of argumentation skills in the three conditions. N = 109 math students were randomized to the three treatment conditions and worked in dyads on mathematical proof tasks in a CSCL environment. Students’ argumentation skills increased between pre- and post-tests with comparable gains in all three conditions. Only for students learning with the adaptable argumentation script, self-regulation skills were a significant positive predictor for argumentation skills.

CK facilitated the scaffolding of grade 5/6 students through phases of collaborative biodiversity (CK2) and astronomy (CK3) inquiry. Using tablets, students contributed to a community knowledge base that was publicly displayed on an interactive whiteboard (IWB). The IWB visualized the community’s idea flow, enabling learners to sort their ideas along socially-negotiated categories. Inquiry work done in the CK environment affected the knowledge work done in the face-to-face classroom discussions, and vice versa. We observed that teachers used an orchestration cycle of Reflect-Refocus-Release (3R) as a means of managing this blended learning environment. A comparison of teachers’ Reflect discourse structures between both iterations, indicate such patterns vary with inquiry task demands.

Using mobile eye-trackers, we examined participants’ visual coordination when solving those problems. We describe two contributions to the CSCL community: first, we propose a methodology for synchronizing two eye-tracking goggles and computing measures of joint visual attention (JVA) in a co-located setting. Second, we report preliminary findings suggesting that participants were more likely to have moments of joint attention when looking at 3D, realistic objects compared to 2D, abstract ones. JVA was also found to be a significant predictor of students’ learning gains and performance during the optimization tasks. We discuss implications of these findings for supporting interactions around a TUI.

Scientific peer review panels offer a site of authentic, collaborative decision making among expert scientists, yet no research has examined the impact of videoconferencing on such decision-making practices. We assigned real, de-identified grant applications submitted to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to four panels of experienced NIH reviewers, one of which met via videoconference. The videoconference panel was slightly more efficient than the face- to-face panels, but the outcomes of their decision making (i.e., the scores assigned to grant applications) did not differ. However, preliminary analyses suggest there are differences in the nature of the collaborative discussion among reviewers between the two meeting formats. We discuss implications for research into technology-mediated collaborative decision making, as well as for the scientific grant peer review process broadly.","Carnes, Molly",13,4,Carnes M.

Self-organization and emergence surround us, all the time and at multiple levels, whether we are aware or not. However, self-organization around idea improvement is rare and requires engaging innovative capacity at all levels, a research-intensive enterprise surrounding innovations, and an open source engineering team committed to enabling new forms of interaction, media, and analytic tools. “Multi-level” envisions inclusion of students, teachers, administrators, researchers, engineers, and policy makers in a collaborative enterprise. This session takes the form of a design think tank to advance conceptual frameworks and means for new and more powerful environments to support a multi-level knowledge building innovation network.","Shirouzu, Hajime",16,18,Shirouzu H.

The new standards are a radical departure from previous standards in their focus on science practices. Not only have general notions of inquiry been replaced by specific science practices students should learn, but the standards articulate a vision of instruction that places student engagement in science practices as the means though which science concepts should be learned. Teacher educators recognize this shift places profound demands on teachers and teacher learning. We report evidence from the start of an NGSS professional development project on how teachers’ understanding of the science practices emerges from their efforts to re-design instruction to align with them. Our analysis suggests teachers’ initial understanding is quite far from the vision of NGSS. We characterize this understanding and consider its implications for teacher professional development.","Sandoval, William A.",20,0,Sandoval W. A.

Our data was collected in a dual eye-tracking setup where dyads of students (N=54) had to interact with a Tangible User Interface (TUI). We selected two groups of students displaying high levels of joint visual attention and compared them using cross-recurrence graphs displaying moments of joint attention from the eye-tracking data, speech data, and by qualitatively analyzing videos generated for that purpose. We found that greater insights can be found by augmenting cross-recurrence graphs with spatial and verbal data, and that high levels of joint visual attention can hide a free-rider effect (Salomon & Globerson, 1989). We conclude by discussing implications for automatically analyzing students’ interactions using dual eye-trackers.","Schneider, Bertrand",19,0,Schneider B.

However, other mechanisms of PF have not yet been investigated in detail. Here, we focus on the role of communication patterns during the initial problem-solving phase. Using existing process data from a PF study, we investigated communication patterns based on the ICAP-model and correlated them with prior knowledge, quantity and quality of student solutions, and conceptual knowledge at post-test.

Findings show that whereas students made statements that positioned themselves as having the correct answer (i.e., as mathematical authorities), some students resorted to a broader arsenal of semiotic resources to make their point, which resulted in differentiated status positions.

It is found that the seeded teachers from the five schools, regardless of their own teaching profiles and school contexts, have obtained high degrees of buy-in of the innovation and developed their readiness towards implementation for the future enactments. It is envisioned that such an epistemic learning model will inform the design for teacher professional development, in the pursuit of innovation diffusion, serving a wider community of the teaching practice.","Wu, Longkai",11,0,Wu L.

Based on classroom observations, we identify five types of SGRs. Following the “perceive–interpret–mobilize” processing flow, teachers demonstrate three processing results (utilize, feedback, and abandon). Further, we identify three approaches of teachers’ utilization of SGRs and five approaches of their feedback to SGRs.

Furthermore, students’ representational flexibility was correlated with their general learning performance when students’ interacted constructively and actively with representations but not when they interacted only actively with representations. In line with the ICAP-framework we conclude that active interactions trigger more intensively attending processes whereas constructive interactions trigger more intensively creating processes and are thus superior to the first kind of students’ cognitive engagement with multiple representations.

One such recent advance concerns open digital badges that contain specific claims of competency and detailed evidence supporting those claims. Some assume that badges should only contain claims and evidence concerning specific measured competencies, while dismissing badges for participating in courses or activities that lack such evidence as “attendance badges.” Others assume awarding badges only for measured competencies bypasses very important forms of social and inquiry-oriented learning, ignores the limitations of assessment and measurement, and limits the transformative potential of web-enabled evidence-rich credentials. An extended study of the 29 projects in the 2012 Badges for Lifelong Learning initiative provided a unique opportunity to explore this enduring debate.

The analysis shows two distinct ways of understanding the length of one meter, which primarily is visible through the children’s gesturing and bodily movement.

This allowed us to identify four types of assessment interventions. The findings indicated that only interventions in the immersion orientation seemed to help students learn how to learn. Such assessment practices enabled students to learn actively and to learn both disciplinary substance and metacognitive/regulative skills. However, relatively few studies clearly integrated assessment and learning. The main contributions of this study are the coding framework and the four patterns of assessment interventions. Together, they provide a new way of thinking about the design of practice. The review provides guidance for the shift of assessment practice to scaffold learning of this field.

Collaboration is determined from the intertwining or overlap of voices emitted by different participants throughout the ongoing conversation. This study presents a validation of this model consisting of a comparison between the output of our system and human evaluations of 10 chat conversations, selected from a corpus of more than 100 chats, in which Computer Science students debated on the advantages and disadvantages of CSCL technologies (e.g., chat, blog, wiki, forum, or Google Wave). The human evaluations of the degree of collaboration between the participants and the automated scores showed good overlap as measured by precision, recall, and F1 scores. Our overarching conclusion is that dialogism derived from the overlapping of voices can be perceived as a signature for collaboration.

The models are tested using data collected from a large US university. Specifically, while the predictive constructs are operationalized through the survey instruments, outcome measures are modeled using electronic trace data and actual evaluation information. Data is analyzed via the Partial Least Squares method. Results demonstrate close relatedness among the constructs and a different influencing mechanism on learning for each. The addition of social interaction as a factor to the learning model increases predictability of student learning as compared to models without this factor.

The paper offers an analysis of the work of four pairs of designers in our Multi-Surface Design Studio. These four dyads were completing a design task we set them, while simultaneously learning how to make good use of the various personal and shared digital tools, display surfaces and other resources in the studio. From observational and interview data, we show how collaborative design for learning needs to be understood as a complex, multiply-situated activity, in which design problem-solving, tools and space usage depend on the fluent deployment of intuitive knowledge about mutual awareness, shared perception, information persistence and movement.

The second factor contrasted state-of-the-art PFL learning activity (i.e., students studying Contrasting Cases) with an interactive tabletop featuring digitally-enhanced manipulatives. In agreement with prior work, we found that students who followed the PFL activity achieved significantly higher learning gains compared to their peers who followed a traditional “Tell & Practice” instruction (large effect size). Additionally, a similar effect was found in favor of the interactive tabletop compared to the Contrasting Cases (small to moderate effect size). Finally, we looked at four predictors to explain those results (students’ endurability, involvement, their curiosity, and the quality of their mental models). We found those variables to predict more than half of the variance (R2 = .58) of students’ learning gains.

Group members showed patterns in their discourse contributions in terms of content, function, and initiation and uptake of discourse topics. The emergence of these patterns stimulated role differentiation and stabilization. Conceptual discussion appeared to improve learning gains, while prioritization of task management detracted from learning.

For this purpose, we built EarExplorer, an interactive tangible system where students can manipulate and connect parts of the auditory system to rebuild a functional structure. An augmented reality layer displays sound waves and shows how they are transformed at various stages of the process. Our previous work suggests that TUIs are particularly good at preparing students for future learning; that is, students learn more when they can explore a novel domain with a TUI before compared to after receiving a traditional (e.g. lecture or text based) instruction. In this study, we isolated the impact of structured guidance versus no guidance during a hands-on TUI activity on learning. In one condition, students rebuilt the hearing system by self-driven discovery; in another condition they rebuilt it by following the step-by-step instructions of a video-teacher. We found that the first group (“discover”) significantly outperformed the second group (“listen”) by ~27% on the final learning test. To explain those results, we analyzed the TUI logs and explored how this effect unfolded with participants of different ability (i.e., low versus high GPA students).

Drawing on an ethnographic study in a design studio course on industrial design, we depict the use of design artifacts in a set of epistemic patterns.

After reclassification, analysis of this literature reveals two main themes that illuminate how mixed instructional methods affect learning outcomes. Courses that use mixed methods can either reduce time in class and maintain learning outcomes or maintain time in class and improve learning outcomes.

Yet, inexperienced writers revise their texts too superficially. Peer-feedback has become a popular method to provide elaborate and timely feedback to students during writing. Though peer-feedback has  shown promising results, studies also indicate that students have problems benefitting from feedback, resulting in a lack of feedback uptake and little revision. Students might need to be facilitated to make sense of feedback and reflect more deeply on it. The study investigated the effect of sense-making support on revision skills and feedback uptake. Altogether, 73 university students were assigned to a condition either with or without sense-making support. Results showed no effect on revision skills, yet results of content-analysis yielded a significant effect for two out of three feedback uptake variables. Students in the condition with sense-making support made less new errors and rejected more incorrect feedback. Sense-making support appeared to help students to some extent to maximize benefit from peer-feedback.

Using mobile eye-trackers, we examined participants’ visual coordination when solving those problems. We describe two contributions to the CSCL community: first, we propose a methodology for synchronizing two eye-tracking goggles and computing measures of joint visual attention (JVA) in a co-located setting. Second, we report preliminary findings suggesting that participants were more likely to have moments of joint attention when looking at 3D, realistic objects compared to 2D, abstract ones. JVA was also found to be a significant predictor of students’ learning gains and performance during the optimization tasks. We discuss implications of these findings for supporting interactions around a TUI.

The dialog analysis of N = 14 blogger communities with a total of 1937 participants identified three main components of textual complexity: dialog participation, structure and cohesion. From these, dialog cohesion was higher in integrative OKCs, thus significantly predicting OKC integrativity. This result adds to previous OKC research by uncovering the depth of OKC discourse.

Twenty-two college freshmen participated in this qualitative research to provide feedback on their peer’s written arguments about popular psychology topics. Constant comparative analysis of multiple data sources revealed three main categories of feedback that students provided: cognition-based, metacognition-based, and affection-based. While receiving cognition-based feedback had the most impacts on how students would later evaluate others’ work, those who had previously provided metacognition-based feedback were more likely to make observed progress in constructing arguments. This work adds to our understanding about the complex nature of peer assessment and proposes a potentially effective approach to facilitate students’ skills in written argumentation.","Liu, Shiyu",10,0,Liu S.

To understand the effects of prompting for gestures on student reasoning, we coded for whether explanations changed in response to these prompts compared to their previous explanations. Results showed that explicit attention to gesturing frequently led to increased attention and specification of mechanism. We describe a few specific cases to illustrate the ways in which gesturing seemed to alter student reasoning, and we describe design implications for computer simulations that are capable of using gestures as input.","Lindgren, Robb",14,0,Lindgren R.

People can and do get interested in STEM-based activities in the various spaces in which they encounter these activities—e.g., the home, museums, hobby fields, school, and after-school programs. However, because each such setting operates under different constraints and affordances, the forms of interest-based participation they spawn and support are qualitatively different. This symposium brings together four distinct research projects, each of which addresses very different settings, aspects, and phenomena in people’s interest-based participation in STEM. The projects also deploy very different methodologies to document and measure people’s interests. By comparing and contrasting these very distinct takes on interests and their manifestations across settings, we gain insight into both generalities and context specific aspects of interests and their enactment.","Azevedo, Flavio S.",18,0,Azevedo F.

We therefore present an intervention study that takes a holistic approach on MA&P skills and their constituents, comparing a sequential (one-by-one) and an integrated (simultaneous) instructional approach to foster each constituent skill as well as students’ overall MA&P skills.

We used a comparison approach to analyze 26 classroom video recordings in order to understand how two teachers framed modeling practices in the same modeling-based unit. In doing so, we analyzed what support teachers provided students as they engaged in modeling and how that might have led to students’ engagement in several epistemic aspects of modeling practices.

Preliminary findings suggest that talking about epistemic concerns without disciplinary engagement is not productive. Embedding epistemic practice in resolving disciplinary disagreements, however uncomplicated it may seem, would foster productive argumentation.

By soliciting and foregrounding students’ diversified ideas in the classroom and beyond, the learning environment communicates to students that their ideas matter to others and that they have a position of responsibility to their own and their peers’ learning processes. The notion of SGIs is embodied in a repertoire of studies at the Learning Sciences Lab, National Institute of Education, Singapore, that offer varied yet overlapping interpretations of how student ideas can inform the design of learning contexts.

This allowed us to identify four types of assessment interventions. The findings indicated that only interventions in the immersion orientation seemed to help students learn how to learn. Such assessment practices enabled students to learn actively and to learn both disciplinary substance and metacognitive/regulative skills. However, relatively few studies clearly integrated assessment and learning. The main contributions of this study are the coding framework and the four patterns of assessment interventions. Together, they provide a new way of thinking about the design of practice. The review provides guidance for the shift of assessment practice to scaffold learning of this field.

We propose a computational model using ReaderBench that assesses collaboration from a dialogical perspective. Accordingly, collaboration emerges from the inter-twining of different points of view or, more specifically, from the inter-animation of voices pertaining to different speakers. Collaboration is determined from the intertwining or overlap of voices emitted by different participants throughout the ongoing conversation. This study presents a validation of this model consisting of a comparison between the output of our system and human evaluations of 10 chat conversations, selected from a corpus of more than 100 chats, in which Computer Science students debated on the advantages and disadvantages of CSCL technologies (e.g., chat, blog, wiki, forum, or Google Wave). The human evaluations of the degree of collaboration between the participants and the automated scores showed good overlap as measured by precision, recall, and F1 scores. Our overarching conclusion is that dialogism derived from the overlapping of voices can be perceived as a signature for collaboration.

In two quasi-experimental studies we investigated whether collaborative as compared to individual learning in PF leads to more learning.

The models are tested using data collected from a large US university. Specifically, while the predictive constructs are operationalized through the survey instruments, outcome measures are modeled using electronic trace data and actual evaluation information. Data is analyzed via the Partial Least Squares method. Results demonstrate close relatedness among the constructs and a different influencing mechanism on learning for each.

The paper offers an analysis of the work of four pairs of designers in our Multi-Surface Design Studio. These four dyads were completing a design task we set them, while simultaneously learning how to make good use of the various personal and shared digital tools, display surfaces and other resources in the studio. From observational and interview data, we show how collaborative design for learning needs to be understood as a complex, multiply-situated activity, in which design problem-solving, tools and space usage depend on the fluent deployment of intuitive knowledge about mutual awareness, shared perception, information persistence and movement.

The second factor contrasted state-of-the-art PFL learning activity (i.e., students studying Contrasting Cases) with an interactive tabletop featuring digitally-enhanced manipulatives. In agreement with prior work, we found that students who followed the PFL activity achieved significantly higher learning gains compared to their peers who followed a traditional “Tell & Practice” instruction (large effect size). Additionally, a similar effect was found in favor of the interactive tabletop compared to the Contrasting Cases (small to moderate effect size). Finally, we looked at four predictors to explain those results (students’ endurability, involvement, their curiosity, and the quality of their mental models). We found those variables to predict more than half of the variance (R2 = .58) of students’ learning gains. We discuss implications for designing constructivist activities using new computer interfaces.

Group members showed patterns in their discourse contributions in terms of content, function, and initiation and uptake of discourse topics. The emergence of these patterns stimulated role differentiation and stabilization. Conceptual discussion appeared to improve learning gains, while prioritization of task management detracted from learning. By tracking group discourse patterns, we can observe the process of role emergence in face-to-face CSCL interactions.

Students found Connected Biology useful (learnable, memorable, satisfying, and error-free) but not efficient. Although they accessed Connected Biology over 15 weeks, they tended to use it primarily to get feedback on their understanding of course content and not for exploratory activities.

Our previous work suggests that TUIs are particularly good at preparing students for future learning; that is, students learn more when they can explore a novel domain with a TUI before compared to after receiving a traditional (e.g. lecture or text based) instruction. In this study, we isolated the impact of structured guidance versus no guidance during a hands-on TUI activity on learning. In one condition, students rebuilt the hearing system by self-driven discovery; in another condition they rebuilt it by following the step-by-step instructions of a video-teacher. We found that the first group (“discover”) significantly outperformed the second group (“listen”) by ~27% on the final learning test. To explain those results, we analyzed the TUI logs and explored how this effect unfolded with participants of different ability (i.e., low versus high GPA students).

Results show that they could reflect on the lesson content and link it to their teaching practice. Also, their peers could get additional perspectives, negotiate meaning, and learn how to reflect better from the reflection shared. Furthermore, they could also gain additional knowledge and emotional support from their peers’ comments.

We found that students participating in an interdisciplinary learning community (LC) who implement their narratives collaboratively as a video game using computer programming produce better concept maps than students in a traditional English composition course. We conclude that the synergies that develop between English composition and computer programming in the interdisciplinary context of a LC result in more effective concept maps leading to an improvement in students’ performance in English composition courses.

After reclassification, analysis of this literature reveals two main themes that illuminate how mixed instructional methods affect learning outcomes. Courses that use mixed methods can either reduce time in class and maintain learning outcomes or maintain time in class and improve learning outcomes.

Three dialog dimensions were identified: participants’ individual content-oriented contribution, social contribution, and their position within the social network. Hierarchical clusters built upon these dimensions reflect socio-cognitive structures including central, regular and peripheral OKC members. OKCs with a stronger layer of regular members appear more likely to integrate new members, whereas OKCs with a stronger layer of peripheral members appear less likely to do so.

CK facilitated the scaffolding of grade 5/6 students through phases of collaborative biodiversity (CK2) and astronomy (CK3) inquiry. Using tablets, students contributed to a community knowledge base that was publicly displayed on an interactive whiteboard (IWB). The IWB visualized the community’s idea flow, enabling learners to sort their ideas along socially-negotiated categories. Inquiry work done in the CK environment affected the knowledge work done in the face-to-face classroom discussions, and vice versa. We observed that teachers used an orchestration cycle of Reflect-Refocus-Release (3R) as a means of managing this blended learning environment. A comparison of teachers’ Reflect discourse structures between both iterations, indicate such patterns vary with inquiry task demands.

Students might need to be facilitated to make sense of feedback and reflect more deeply on it. The study investigated the effect of sense-making support on revision skills and feedback uptake. Altogether, 73 university students were assigned to a condition either with or without sense-making support. Results showed no effect on revision skills, yet results of content-analysis yielded a significant effect for two out of three feedback uptake variables. Students in the condition with sense-making support made less new errors and rejected more incorrect feedback.

After collaboration, however, it is not always clear what students internalize from this interaction. Even when students are aware of group-work benefits, effective collaboration does not necessarily occur spontaneously within the group context. To address this potential issue, the teacher can facilitate collaboration by modeling how to foster elaborative group discussions. In this paper, we evaluate how teacher modeling of collaboration prompts may increase the quantity and quality of concepts that students internalize before, during, and after collaboration. We found that students who did not observe modeling increased the quantity of connection on their post concept maps. In contrast, students who did receive modeling increased both the quantity and quality of their connections. This suggests that modeling of prompts before collaboration can deepen the internalization of concepts.

In this work, we examined math collaboration discourse between 11 4th grade dyads in 30-second slices to investigate the relationship between rapport state and reasoning state. Prior to collaboration, students watched one of three instructional videos modeling either domain knowledge, collaborate reasoning, or both. There was no impact of video type on student talk behaviors, nor posttest scores. However, we found a correlation between high rapport states and strong reasoning states, as well as a marginal effect of more co-constructive reasoning leading to improved posttest scores. This work demonstrates that students’ rapport states may play a role in students’ reasoning states, and thus calls for a deeper investigation within the CSCL community about the role of rapport in peer learning.","Olsen, Jennifer K.",18,0,Olsen J.

However, explicit forms of scaffolding may provide additional benefits from the reification of the processes that they provide, which could be received as instruction. This paper contributes to research on dynamic support for collaborative learning by proposing a novel form of micro-level prompt designed to elevate the amount of Transactive exchange.

In the discussion, we address how these perceptions inform the design and development of more equitable pair e-crafting arrangements.","Litts, Breanne K.",17,0,Litts B. K.

We examined the types of portfolio entries at two youth-serving makerspaces (one out-of-school and one in-school), and observed the documentation of personal and shared projects in personal and shared portfolios. Our main findings are that, compared to portfolios that focused on personal work alone, portfolios that included shared projects and documentation presented richer showcases, showing technical and social engagement, assessment by people across a distributed community, and possibilities to narrate work to multiple audiences. This has implications on the facilitation of maker portfolios and broadens portfolio assessment to show the role of the learner in society.","Keune, Anna",11,0,Keune A.

Sharing is predicted by individual differences, such as gender, collectivist values, mastery goal orientations and academic self-efficacy.

When vibing with one another, skaters and videographers fall into collaborative, rhythmic cycles. This collaborative mastery is illustrated specifically through a focus on the cycles of reflection and nurture that skaters and videographers enter into when honing their respective crafts.

Perhaps surprisingly, pairs with the highest quality solutions also expressed more uncertainty than the middle performers. Examining the ways in which students expressed and then followed up on uncertainty revealed that higher-performing pairs utilized emerging learning opportunities when uncertainty was expressed, and remained focused on one task at a time. In contrast, the lower-performing pairs often did not resolve their uncertainty before moving on, attempting to work with multiple incomplete pieces of the solution simultaneously.

However, in open-ended collaborative small group work where learners make unique solutions to tasks that involve robotics, electronics, programming, and design artefacts evidence on the effectiveness of using these learning activities are hard to find. The paper argues that multimodal learning analytics (MMLA) can offer novel methods that can generate unique information about what happens when students are engaged in collaborative, project-based learning activities. Through the use of multimodal learning analytics platform, we collected various streams of data, processed and extracted multimodal interactions to answer the following question: which features of MMLA are good predictors of collaborative problem-solving in open-ended tasks in project-based learning? Manual entered scores of CPS were regressed using machine-learning methods. The answer to the question provides potential ways to automatically identify aspects of collaboration in project-based learning.","Spikol, Daniel",14,0,Spikol D.

The new standards are a radical departure from previous standards in their focus on science practices. Not only have general notions of inquiry been replaced by specific science practices students should learn, but the standards articulate a vision of instruction that places student engagement in science practices as the means though which science concepts should be learned. Teacher educators recognize this shift places profound demands on teachers and teacher learning. We report evidence from the start of an NGSS professional development project on how teachers’ understanding of the science practices emerges from their efforts to re-design instruction to align with them. Our analysis suggests teachers’ initial understanding is quite far from the vision of NGSS. We characterize this understanding and consider its implications for teacher professional development.","Rodriguez, Lilia",16,3,Rodriguez L.

We selected two groups of students displaying high levels of joint visual attention and compared them using cross-recurrence graphs displaying moments of joint attention from the eye-tracking data, speech data, and by qualitatively analyzing videos generated for that purpose. We found that greater insights can be found by augmenting cross-recurrence graphs with spatial and verbal data, and that high levels of joint visual attention can hide a free-rider effect (Salomon & Globerson, 1989).

The study examines whether this perceptual compensation creates a comparable learning environment. Students who are blind worked with auditory models; sighted students used visual models. Conceptual understanding and systems reasoning were assessed with pre- and post-test questionnaires. Learning processes were captured by analyzing their workbook writings. The L2C environment not only supported blind students’ learning similarly, but also furthered their learning with one of the more challenging concepts, diffusion.

The key phase of having a shared understanding is to have a common ground between the pair. Previous studies showed that explicit deixis plays a major role in initiating and maintaining common ground. This led us to hypothesize that augmenting videos with teacher’s deictic gestures might help students perform better.

In this paper we present a careful analysis of an intervention designed to overcome coordination difficulties by welcoming students into the chat on a rolling basis as they arrive rather than requiring them to be matched with a partner before beginning.

We propose a computational model using ReaderBench that assesses collaboration from a dialogical perspective. Accordingly, collaboration emerges from the inter-twining of different points of view or, more specifically, from the inter-animation of voices pertaining to different speakers. Collaboration is determined from the intertwining or overlap of voices emitted by different participants throughout the ongoing conversation. This study presents a validation of this model consisting of a comparison between the output of our system and human evaluations of 10 chat conversations, selected from a corpus of more than 100 chats, in which Computer Science students debated on the advantages and disadvantages of CSCL technologies (e.g., chat, blog, wiki, forum, or Google Wave). The human evaluations of the degree of collaboration between the participants and the automated scores showed good overlap as measured by precision, recall, and F1 scores. Our overarching conclusion is that dialogism derived from the overlapping of voices can be perceived as a signature for collaboration.

DALITE was designed around the principles of peer instruction, in particular, self-explanation and intentional reflection. DALITE consists of two databases: a database of college-level physics questions and another of student-generated rationales. We report on the iterative design process that has shaped this web-based asynchronous learning environment and on its use as part of an active learning pedagogy. Using mixed methods we have tested DALITE’s effectiveness to support conceptual change, examined the content of its databases, observed its use in classrooms, and conducted interviews from users – students as well as instructors. These data help to reveal the conditions of DALITE’s effectiveness. We discuss our findings and provide design guidelines.

Despite growing awareness in the CSCL community of the importance of design in teachers’ work, there has been very little empirical research on how such design is carried out, or how design for CSCL can be supported and improved through the provision of better design tools and design methods. The paper offers an analysis of the work of four pairs of designers in our Multi-Surface Design Studio. These four dyads were completing a design task we set them, while simultaneously learning how to make good use of the various personal and shared digital tools, display surfaces and other resources in the studio. From observational and interview data, we show how collaborative design for learning needs to be understood as a complex, multiply-situated activity, in which design problem-solving, tools and space usage depend on the fluent deployment of intuitive knowledge about mutual awareness, shared perception, information persistence and movement.

Five curricular units have been developed on the topics of enzymes, ecology, protein synthesis, gene regulation, and sugar transport. In this exploratory study we were interested in understanding the extent to which students demonstrated understanding and skills in NGSS areas as they were designed. Evidence is gleaned from classroom observations and interviews with 50 students selected from the larger population of 352 students who worked with project resources during the 2013-2014 school year. Findings revealed that students demonstrated understanding and skills in all NGSS scientific practices and crosscutting themes particularly in the areas of developing and using models, analyzing and interpreting data, cause and effect, and systems and system models.

The results show that members of class A had more comprehensive and coherent awareness of the various inquiry themes discussed by their community focusing on deep conceptualization of electricity. Informed by the reflective awareness, classroom A also engaged in more active and connected online discourse to address deepening issues and develop coherent explanations across different lines of inquiry.

Immediately upon task completion, students reported their epistemic emotions as well as motivation during the task. Path analyses revealed that epistemic emotions during problem solving predicted the motivation students invested in solving the complex reasoning task. Finally, intrinsic motivation positively predicted task performance. The findings suggest complex linkages of epistemic emotions with motivational mechanisms during reasoning and knowledge generating processes and demonstrate the adaptive and maladaptive functions of epistemic emotions.

People can and do get interested in STEM-based activities in the various spaces in which they encounter these activities—e.g., the home, museums, hobby fields, school, and after-school programs. However, because each such setting operates under different constraints and affordances, the forms of interest-based participation they spawn and support are qualitatively different. This symposium brings together four distinct research projects, each of which addresses very different settings, aspects, and phenomena in people’s interest-based participation in STEM. The projects also deploy very different methodologies to document and measure people’s interests. By comparing and contrasting these very distinct takes on interests and their manifestations across settings, we gain insight into both generalities and context specific aspects of interests and their enactment.","Dorph, Rena",11,3,Dorph R.

This paper outlines one system devised by a team of design-based researchers for documenting their research process and organizing their data. Inspired by the hierarchical workflow model suggested by Hackbarth et al.

By soliciting and foregrounding students’ diversified ideas in the classroom and beyond, the learning environment communicates to students that their ideas matter to others and that they have a position of responsibility to their own and their peers’ learning processes. The notion of SGIs is embodied in a repertoire of studies at the Learning Sciences Lab, National Institute of Education, Singapore, that offer varied yet overlapping interpretations of how student ideas can inform the design of learning contexts. In sharing the core design principles for SGIs approaches, this work contributes important components to the learning sciences discipline and changing educational practice.","Huang, Jun Song",15,3,Huang J.

Our study presents early efforts to understand how embodiment might support or hinder 2nd graders’ expressions of states of matter (N=18). Results indicate that when students are less familiar with content or provided fewer details in other modes of communication, embodiment provides an alternative way to express their understanding. Moreover, the intervention familiarized students with how to use embodiment to express themselves which led students to yield responses which were just as nuanced as other modes of communication.

We propose a computational model using ReaderBench that assesses collaboration from a dialogical perspective. Accordingly, collaboration emerges from the inter-twining of different points of view or, more specifically, from the inter-animation of voices pertaining to different speakers. Collaboration is determined from the intertwining or overlap of voices emitted by different participants throughout the ongoing conversation. This study presents a validation of this model consisting of a comparison between the output of our system and human evaluations of 10 chat conversations, selected from a corpus of more than 100 chats, in which Computer Science students debated on the advantages and disadvantages of CSCL technologies (e.g., chat, blog, wiki, forum, or Google Wave). The human evaluations of the degree of collaboration between the participants and the automated scores showed good overlap as measured by precision, recall, and F1 scores. Our overarching conclusion is that dialogism derived from the overlapping of voices can be perceived as a signature for collaboration.

The paper offers an analysis of the work of four pairs of designers in our Multi-Surface Design Studio. These four dyads were completing a design task we set them, while simultaneously learning how to make good use of the various personal and shared digital tools, display surfaces and other resources in the studio. From observational and interview data, we show how collaborative design for learning needs to be understood as a complex, multiply-situated activity, in which design problem-solving, tools and space usage depend on the fluent deployment of intuitive knowledge about mutual awareness, shared perception, information persistence and movement.

Pre-post analyses indicate that the majority of students learned the content and demonstrate how the design promotes distinct forms of reflection. In particular, it appears that students attended to the projected simulation at key moments in play and then reflected on the underlying rules of the content.

Integrating collaborative technologies into a textbook platform provides substantial opportunities for facilitating classroom discourse surrounding the textbook content. However, to be successful in a digital textbook, these technologies have to be perceived by students as useful, and must function well on the tablet platform. This paper proposes the integration of Q&A into a digital textbook platform as a way of facilitating productive collaboration, designing for the tablet, and engaging students with the technology. We describe our implementation of an integrated Q&A system and digital textbook, and outline the results of a pilot study that demonstrate how the Q&A system might be effectively used by groups of students.

We compare across three communication media provided to students in that context in terms of relative popularity and overlap in student sub-populations. We also compare the communication between these contexts in terms of their content focus, concentration of reasoning articulation, and the interaction between the two.  This comparison allows investigating the specific contribution of synchronous collaboration in a MOOC, which is relatively novel.  The analysis suggests that there is value in providing a diverse set of discussion contexts in that they may lend themselves to differently natured interactions, but that it creates a need for greater efforts towards effective bridging between media and channeling of students to pockets of interaction that are potentially of personal benefit.

This premise of learning in SCOLEs is analyzed in the current study. Based on the approaches of voices interanimation and polyphony, a natural language processing tool was employed for dialog analysis in integrative vs. non-integrative blog-based OKCs. Three dialog dimensions were identified: participants’ individual content-oriented contribution, social contribution, and their position within the social network. Hierarchical clusters built upon these dimensions reflect socio-cognitive structures including central, regular and peripheral OKC members. OKCs with a stronger layer of regular members appear more likely to integrate new members, whereas OKCs with a stronger layer of peripheral members appear less likely to do so. Consequently, the study suggests an automated prediction method of OKC integrativity that may sustain the educational use of OKCs.

This study compares the effects of three argumentation scripts (high structured vs. low structured vs. adaptable) on students’ argumentation skills. Furthermore, we investigate to what extent students’ self-regulation skills influence the acquisition of argumentation skills in the three conditions. N = 109 math students were randomized to the three treatment conditions and worked in dyads on mathematical proof tasks in a CSCL environment. Students’ argumentation skills increased between pre- and post-tests with comparable gains in all three conditions. Only for students learning with the adaptable argumentation script, self-regulation skills were a significant positive predictor for argumentation skills.

Selecting appropriate collaboration partners may moreover require what we call cognitive group awareness, (i.e. knowledge about the knowledge of others). In a field study at two multi-disciplinary scientific events (Alpine Rendez-Vous 2011 and 2013) including N=287 researchers, we investigated selection patterns, looking specifically at career level and disciplinary background, and included a cognitive group awareness intervention. While we could not completely explain how researchers choose with whom they interact, we found that transitivity and interaction duration are relevant for later collaboration.

Collaborative technologies play an increasing role in initial VET. This paper presents a systematic review on the use of CSCL in initial VET. Starting from an initial set of 823 papers, identified in major databases, each paper was coded by multiple researchers to identify demographics (sample sizes, countries, work domains), methods (data sources, technology design) and outcomes (analysis, forms of collaboration). Finally, only 26 papers met our selection criteria, which illustrates that CSCL research is dominated by K-12 and higher education contexts, while vocational learning contexts are under-represented in this field of study. This observation spurs the question if there is anything unique in VET worthy of being investigated through a CSCL framework. Our analysis hints at a positive answer to this question, both for technological and collaborative components. ","Cattaneo, Alberto A. P.",23,3,Cattaneo A. A.

For the CSCL research community, the adoption of SNA techniques as part of the methodological repertoire requires adequate understanding of the core concepts, their potential contributions, and limitations. We started from the hypotheses that (1) most applications of SNA in CSCL research make use of a small set of basic methods; and (2) the discourse related to SNA is partly inadequate or imprecise. To further analyze and corroborate these “issue hypotheses” we have used network analysis techniques in order to reveal relations between SNA measures and specific aspects of CSCL research (activities, contexts, research methods) based on a corpus of 90 published studies.

We interpret the findings as enabling us to revisit, support, refine, and elaborate on central claims of Piaget’s theory of genetic epistemology and in particular his insistence on the role of situated motor-action coordination in the process of reflective abstraction.","Shayan, Shakila",15,1,Shayan S.

The new standards are a radical departure from previous standards in their focus on science practices. Not only have general notions of inquiry been replaced by specific science practices students should learn, but the standards articulate a vision of instruction that places student engagement in science practices as the means though which science concepts should be learned. Teacher educators recognize this shift places profound demands on teachers and teacher learning. We report evidence from the start of an NGSS professional development project on how teachers’ understanding of the science practices emerges from their efforts to re-design instruction to align with them. Our analysis suggests teachers’ initial understanding is quite far from the vision of NGSS. We characterize this understanding and consider its implications for teacher professional development.","Kawasaki, Jarod",15,1,Kawasaki J.

We selected two groups of students displaying high levels of joint visual attention and compared them using cross-recurrence graphs displaying moments of joint attention from the eye-tracking data, speech data, and by qualitatively analyzing videos generated for that purpose. We found that greater insights can be found by augmenting cross-recurrence graphs with spatial and verbal data, and that high levels of joint visual attention can hide a free-rider effect (Salomon & Globerson, 1989).

Using existing process data from a PF study, we investigated communication patterns based on the ICAP-model and correlated them with prior knowledge, quantity and quality of student solutions, and conceptual knowledge at post-test.

But by introducing rich representations of practice, the facilitators attuned teachers’ attention to key conceptual resources. This scaffolded the workgroup into new forms of practice, thereby supporting teachers’ opportunities to learn more ambitious forms of professional practice.

We describe this epistemic learning model and explore its effectiveness. Various types of data were collected, including surveys, interviews, field notes, and teachers’ lesson design artifacts. It is found that the seeded teachers from the five schools, regardless of their own teaching profiles and school contexts, have obtained high degrees of buy-in of the innovation and developed their readiness towards implementation for the future enactments.

We explore ways to design guidance for short essays that promotes meaningful revision rather than superficial changes. Specifically we compare the affordances of annotation of a fictional essay to knowledge integration guidance on revision of science writing. 293 middle-school students were randomly assigned to condition. Students who annotated an essay made significantly greater pre to post test gains and were also better able to use automated guidance on a posttest item than students who only received knowledge integration guidance. These findings suggest ways to support students to revise science writ-ing and build integrated understanding of science.,"Linn, Marcia C.",15,1,Linn M. C.

We found that a combination of students’ constructive and active interaction (e.g., manipulating and constructing representations) with multiple fractions representations as compared to students’ active interaction (e.g., looking at representations) with multiple representations leads to higher conceptual knowledge measured by students’ ability to flexibly represent a fraction. Furthermore, students’ representational flexibility was correlated with their general learning performance when students’ interacted constructively and actively with representations but not when they interacted only actively with representations. In line with the ICAP-framework we conclude that active interactions trigger more intensively attending processes whereas constructive interactions trigger more intensively creating processes and are thus superior to the first kind of students’ cognitive engagement with multiple representations.

In this paper we present a careful analysis of an intervention designed to overcome coordination difficulties by welcoming students into the chat on a rolling basis as they arrive rather than requiring them to be matched with a partner before beginning. The results suggest the most positive impact when experiencing a chat with exactly one partner rather than more or less.

Social science content was used to help students see the purpose and value of scientific practices. The objective was largely met, as evidenced by two 6th grade classes (n = 49), both outperforming a control group (n = 23). Although students engaged successfully in argument and counterargument, less successful was meta-level reasoning about argumentation and nature of science. Importantly in its practical implications, one intervention group showed less gain in 10 45-min whole-class sessions than did the other group who engaged as pairs in the same sequence of activities over an average of six 24-min individualized sessions, suggesting the greater efficacy of individualized engagement.","Kuhn, Deanna",12,1,Kuhn D.

The 57 studies that satisfied our search criteria were coded using a framework that considered the nature of the assessment intervention, the purposes of the assessment intervention, and the role of technology in student learning. This allowed us to identify four types of assessment interventions. The findings indicated that only interventions in the immersion orientation seemed to help students learn how to learn. Such assessment practices enabled students to learn actively and to learn both disciplinary substance and metacognitive/regulative skills. However, relatively few studies clearly integrated assessment and learning. The main contributions of this study are the coding framework and the four patterns of assessment interventions. Together, they provide a new way of thinking about the design of practice. The review provides guidance for the shift of assessment practice to scaffold learning of this field.

We propose a computational model using ReaderBench that assesses collaboration from a dialogical perspective. Accordingly, collaboration emerges from the inter-twining of different points of view or, more specifically, from the inter-animation of voices pertaining to different speakers. Collaboration is determined from the intertwining or overlap of voices emitted by different participants throughout the ongoing conversation. This study presents a validation of this model consisting of a comparison between the output of our system and human evaluations of 10 chat conversations, selected from a corpus of more than 100 chats, in which Computer Science students debated on the advantages and disadvantages of CSCL technologies (e.g., chat, blog, wiki, forum, or Google Wave). The human evaluations of the degree of collaboration between the participants and the automated scores showed good overlap as measured by precision, recall, and F1 scores. Our overarching conclusion is that dialogism derived from the overlapping of voices can be perceived as a signature for collaboration.

Analysis of lexical proficiency based on Lexical Frequency Profile and P_Lex indicated significant growth in productive written vocabulary, especially for words beyond the first two 1,000 word lists. By tracing the growth of vocabulary extracted from specific word lists, we found that the growth rate for different types of words varied across each year but correlated with each other. Correlation analyses between these lexical measures and Knowledge Building behavioral indicators revealed that note revisions are the strongest predictor of vocabulary growth rate, whereas note reading is related with lexical proficiency measures.

Based on social cognitive theory, this study proposes two dynamic CSCL models of learning using understudied factors – system functionality, social ability, collective efficacy and social interaction – to examine mediation and causal relationships among these constructs and their influence on learning. The models are tested using data collected from a large US university. Specifically, while the predictive constructs are operationalized through the survey instruments, outcome measures are modeled using electronic trace data and actual evaluation information. Data is analyzed via the Partial Least Squares method. Results demonstrate close relatedness among the constructs and a different influencing mechanism on learning for each. The addition of social interaction as a factor to the learning model increases predictability of student learning as compared to models without this factor. The paper concludes with discussion of the implications of this study.

These four dyads were completing a design task we set them, while simultaneously learning how to make good use of the various personal and shared digital tools, display surfaces and other resources in the studio. From observational and interview data, we show how collaborative design for learning needs to be understood as a complex, multiply-situated activity, in which design problem-solving, tools and space usage depend on the fluent deployment of intuitive knowledge about mutual awareness, shared perception, information persistence and movement.

The second factor contrasted state-of-the-art PFL learning activity (i.e., students studying Contrasting Cases) with an interactive tabletop featuring digitally-enhanced manipulatives. In agreement with prior work, we found that students who followed the PFL activity achieved significantly higher learning gains compared to their peers who followed a traditional “Tell & Practice” instruction (large effect size). Additionally, a similar effect was found in favor of the interactive tabletop compared to the Contrasting Cases (small to moderate effect size). Finally, we looked at four predictors to explain those results (students’ endurability, involvement, their curiosity, and the quality of their mental models). We found those variables to predict more than half of the variance (R2 = .58) of students’ learning gains. We discuss implications for designing constructivist activities using new computer interfaces.

The paper argues that we need to attend to the prevailing culture of introductory science courses (both student and teacher) before introducing Web 2.0 tools. Only then will the affordances of Web 2.0 tools be attained.

An augmented reality layer displays sound waves and shows how they are transformed at various stages of the process. Our previous work suggests that TUIs are particularly good at preparing students for future learning; that is, students learn more when they can explore a novel domain with a TUI before compared to after receiving a traditional (e.g. lecture or text based) instruction. In this study, we isolated the impact of structured guidance versus no guidance during a hands-on TUI activity on learning. In one condition, students rebuilt the hearing system by self-driven discovery; in another condition they rebuilt it by following the step-by-step instructions of a video-teacher. We found that the first group (“discover”) significantly outperformed the second group (“listen”) by ~27% on the final learning test. To explain those results, we analyzed the TUI logs and explored how this effect unfolded with participants of different ability (i.e., low versus high GPA students).

To address this problem, we use the definitions from a recently proposed taxonomy to reclassify studies in the literature.  After reclassification, analysis of this literature reveals two main themes that illuminate how mixed instructional methods affect learning outcomes. Courses that use mixed methods can either reduce time in class and maintain learning outcomes or maintain time in class and improve learning outcomes.

We surface two noteworthy patterns about a) how learners in small groups leverage semiotic resources to negotiate, repair and converge at shared meaning in changing contextual configurations and b) how prior learning experiences affect the way learners employ semiotic resources.

We investigate the real and perceived impacts of different prompts for students’ use of peers’ ideas. 144 middle school students used an online tool to exchange ideas during a science inquiry unit. Students prompted to seek ideas different from their own perceived their peers as having greater impact on their thinking than students prompted to seek ideas that reinforced their own. Although students’ revisions after exchanging ideas showed no actual change, students who diversified their ideas later showed significantly greater pre to post test gains. These findings suggest ways that technologies can be designed to best support students in taking advantage of peers as learning resources.

Though peer-feedback has  shown promising results, studies also indicate that students have problems benefitting from feedback, resulting in a lack of feedback uptake and little revision. Students might need to be facilitated to make sense of feedback and reflect more deeply on it. The study investigated the effect of sense-making support on revision skills and feedback uptake. Altogether, 73 university students were assigned to a condition either with or without sense-making support. Results showed no effect on revision skills, yet results of content-analysis yielded a significant effect for two out of three feedback uptake variables. Students in the condition with sense-making support made less new errors and rejected more incorrect feedback. Sense-making support appeared to help students to some extent to maximize benefit from peer-feedback.

Using mobile eye-trackers, we examined participants’ visual coordination when solving those problems. We describe two contributions to the CSCL community: first, we propose a methodology for synchronizing two eye-tracking goggles and computing measures of joint visual attention (JVA) in a co-located setting. Second, we report preliminary findings suggesting that participants were more likely to have moments of joint attention when looking at 3D, realistic objects compared to 2D, abstract ones. JVA was also found to be a significant predictor of students’ learning gains and performance during the optimization tasks. We discuss implications of these findings for supporting interactions around a TUI.

From these, dialog cohesion was higher in integrative OKCs, thus significantly predicting OKC integrativity. This result adds to previous OKC research by uncovering the depth of OKC discourse.

Specifically we examine what happens when explicit attention and reflection is brought to students’ own gestures. Interviews were conducted with middle school students about their understanding of 3 critical science topics, and participants were frequently asked by the interviewer to “show me” when attempting to describe the unobservable mechanisms (e.g., molecular interactions) underlying observable phenomena. To understand the effects of prompting for gestures on student reasoning, we coded for whether explanations changed in response to these prompts compared to their previous explanations. Results showed that explicit attention to gesturing frequently led to increased attention and specification of mechanism. We describe a few specific cases to illustrate the ways in which gesturing seemed to alter student reasoning, and we describe design implications for computer simulations that are capable of using gestures as input.","Wallon, Robert C.",17,1,Wallon R.

People can and do get interested in STEM-based activities in the various spaces in which they encounter these activities—e.g., the home, museums, hobby fields, school, and after-school programs. However, because each such setting operates under different constraints and affordances, the forms of interest-based participation they spawn and support are qualitatively different. This symposium brings together four distinct research projects, each of which addresses very different settings, aspects, and phenomena in people’s interest-based participation in STEM. The projects also deploy very different methodologies to document and measure people’s interests. By comparing and contrasting these very distinct takes on interests and their manifestations across settings, we gain insight into both generalities and context specific aspects of interests and their enactment.","Ahn, June",9,1,Ahn J.

Transferring research on the facilitation of complex cognitive skills from instructional design, two approaches may be effective: Fostering the constituents one by one respectively fostering them simultaneously. We therefore present an intervention study that takes a holistic approach on MA&P skills and their constituents, comparing a sequential (one-by-one) and an integrated (simultaneous) instructional approach to foster each constituent skill as well as students’ overall MA&P skills.

Preliminary findings suggest that talking about epistemic concerns without disciplinary engagement is not productive. Embedding epistemic practice in resolving disciplinary disagreements, however uncomplicated it may seem, would foster productive argumentation. Understanding what disagreements are challengingly resolvable and how both epistemic and disciplinary practices play a role in evaluating claims thus sheds needed light on designing effective learning environments that foster deep learning.","Sandoval, William A.",20,1,Sandoval W.

A clustering analysis of students’ regulation scripts revealed that they developed scripts through a variety of trajectories. Further case studies suggested: (1) that students develop their scripts when they recognized meaningful challenges, (2) that they construct scripts of socially shared regulation when they recognize epistemic challenge whereas they do co-regulation scripts when they recognize socio-emotional challenge.","Oshima, Jun",11,1,Oshima J.

By soliciting and foregrounding students’ diversified ideas in the classroom and beyond, the learning environment communicates to students that their ideas matter to others and that they have a position of responsibility to their own and their peers’ learning processes. The notion of SGIs is embodied in a repertoire of studies at the Learning Sciences Lab, National Institute of Education, Singapore, that offer varied yet overlapping interpretations of how student ideas can inform the design of learning contexts.

The analysis shows two distinct ways of understanding the length of one meter, which primarily is visible through the children’s gesturing and bodily movement.

Results indicate that when students are less familiar with content or provided fewer details in other modes of communication, embodiment provides an alternative way to express their understanding.

This allowed us to identify four types of assessment interventions. The findings indicated that only interventions in the immersion orientation seemed to help students learn how to learn. Such assessment practices enabled students to learn actively and to learn both disciplinary substance and metacognitive/regulative skills. However, relatively few studies clearly integrated assessment and learning. The main contributions of this study are the coding framework and the four patterns of assessment interventions. Together, they provide a new way of thinking about the design of practice. The review provides guidance for the shift of assessment practice to scaffold learning of this field.

We propose a computational model using ReaderBench that assesses collaboration from a dialogical perspective. Accordingly, collaboration emerges from the inter-twining of different points of view or, more specifically, from the inter-animation of voices pertaining to different speakers. Collaboration is determined from the intertwining or overlap of voices emitted by different participants throughout the ongoing conversation. This study presents a validation of this model consisting of a comparison between the output of our system and human evaluations of 10 chat conversations, selected from a corpus of more than 100 chats, in which Computer Science students debated on the advantages and disadvantages of CSCL technologies (e.g., chat, blog, wiki, forum, or Google Wave). The human evaluations of the degree of collaboration between the participants and the automated scores showed good overlap as measured by precision, recall, and F1 scores. Our overarching conclusion is that dialogism derived from the overlapping of voices can be perceived as a signature for collaboration.

As a vehicle of role-play, puppetry achieves this benefit while creating a psychological distance from the role-player’s actual identity, meaning that the player’s anxiety or apprehension toward evaluation is reduced. EduceBoard is a tangible system that enables participants to conduct role-play using puppets and foster reflection based on the diverse perspectives of the characters in the role-play. Preliminary evaluation of EduceBoard demonstrated that it allowed participants to play various roles in role-play and helped them reflect on their role-play from a variety of perspectives. In this paper, we also discuss how we can foster successful transfer of what they have learned to their self-performance in role-play or in real-life context.

The models are tested using data collected from a large US university. Specifically, while the predictive constructs are operationalized through the survey instruments, outcome measures are modeled using electronic trace data and actual evaluation information. Data is analyzed via the Partial Least Squares method. Results demonstrate close relatedness among the constructs and a different influencing mechanism on learning for each. The addition of social interaction as a factor to the learning model increases predictability of student learning as compared to models without this factor.

They had to prepare jointly for an upcoming negotiation via audio conference. In the condition with Preference Awareness, the priorities, which were stated by the team members afterwards, covered the preferences of all team members significantly better than in the condition without awareness.

The second factor contrasted state-of-the-art PFL learning activity (i.e., students studying Contrasting Cases) with an interactive tabletop featuring digitally-enhanced manipulatives. In agreement with prior work, we found that students who followed the PFL activity achieved significantly higher learning gains compared to their peers who followed a traditional “Tell & Practice” instruction (large effect size). Additionally, a similar effect was found in favor of the interactive tabletop compared to the Contrasting Cases (small to moderate effect size). Finally, we looked at four predictors to explain those results (students’ endurability, involvement, their curiosity, and the quality of their mental models). We found those variables to predict more than half of the variance (R2 = .58) of students’ learning gains. We discuss implications for designing constructivist activities using new computer interfaces.

Specifically, we documented three cases of learners in an afterschool program called Kitchen Chemistry and their use of a social media app called ScienceKit. Analysis of ScienceKit data with facilitator interactions reveals a typology of learner paths across connected learning experiences. Furthermore, understanding typologies that best match each learner appears to be critical for helping learners to make connections across interest-driven and peer-supported scientific inquiry.

We found that students participating in an interdisciplinary learning community (LC) who implement their narratives collaboratively as a video game using computer programming produce better concept maps than students in a traditional English composition course.

We contend that these conflicting results are due to inconsistent or vague definitions of hybrid, blended, and flipped. To address this problem, we use the definitions from a recently proposed taxonomy to reclassify studies in the literature.  After reclassification, analysis of this literature reveals two main themes that illuminate how mixed instructional methods affect learning outcomes.

In this paper we look at how supportive communities can improve resilience by mitigating stereotype threat, and thereby helping to protect vulnerable groups from the negative effects of implicit and explicit bias in gaming culture and game-based learning activities. Our findings demonstrate that a female-supportive gaming community can foster equitable gaming identification and self-concept, and we propose that similar models can be used with other marginalized groups (i.e., ethnic/racial minorities).

We also compare the communication between these contexts in terms of their content focus, concentration of reasoning articulation, and the interaction between the two.  This comparison allows investigating the specific contribution of synchronous collaboration in a MOOC, which is relatively novel.  The analysis suggests that there is value in providing a diverse set of discussion contexts in that they may lend themselves to differently natured interactions, but that it creates a need for greater efforts towards effective bridging between media and channeling of students to pockets of interaction that are potentially of personal benefit.

Three dialog dimensions were identified: participants’ individual content-oriented contribution, social contribution, and their position within the social network. Hierarchical clusters built upon these dimensions reflect socio-cognitive structures including central, regular and peripheral OKC members. OKCs with a stronger layer of regular members appear more likely to integrate new members, whereas OKCs with a stronger layer of peripheral members appear less likely to do so.

After collaboration, however, it is not always clear what students internalize from this interaction. Even when students are aware of group-work benefits, effective collaboration does not necessarily occur spontaneously within the group context. To address this potential issue, the teacher can facilitate collaboration by modeling how to foster elaborative group discussions. In this paper, we evaluate how teacher modeling of collaboration prompts may increase the quantity and quality of concepts that students internalize before, during, and after collaboration. We found that students who did not observe modeling increased the quantity of connection on their post concept maps. In contrast, students who did receive modeling increased both the quantity and quality of their connections. This suggests that modeling of prompts before collaboration can deepen the internalization of concepts.

The results show that members of class A had more comprehensive and coherent awareness of the various inquiry themes discussed by their community focusing on deep conceptualization of electricity. Informed by the reflective awareness, classroom A also engaged in more active and connected online discourse to address deepening issues and develop coherent explanations across different lines of inquiry.

In this study, we examine one online Maker community called SoliForum to better understand how an emphasis on producing physical objects shapes online interaction. Specifically, we investigate what kinds of messages elicit useful responses for those seeking help. We found that, compared to posts that contained only text, posts that contained media elements such as images and videos had a higher response rate and more resolved problems. Based on our analysis we attribute this to the more descriptive and explanatory power of multimedia elements and their ability to represent physical objects.

Scientific peer review panels offer a site of authentic, collaborative decision making among expert scientists, yet no research has examined the impact of videoconferencing on such decision-making practices. We assigned real, de-identified grant applications submitted to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to four panels of experienced NIH reviewers, one of which met via videoconference. The videoconference panel was slightly more efficient than the face- to-face panels, but the outcomes of their decision making (i.e., the scores assigned to grant applications) did not differ. However, preliminary analyses suggest there are differences in the nature of the collaborative discussion among reviewers between the two meeting formats. We discuss implications for research into technology-mediated collaborative decision making, as well as for the scientific grant peer review process broadly.","Raclaw, Joshua",14,1,Raclaw J.

Literature has revealed that learners had difficulties in collaborative argumentation on SSIs. The use of knowledge building pedagogies may be helpful for facilitating students’ collaborative argumentation. To examine the perspective above, this study attempted to integrate the KB pedagogies in collaborative argumentation regarding SSIs. In this study, learners’ collaborative learning behavior patterns in the context of online argumentation learning activities were explored. The participants were 48 university students from two classes and were randomly divided into experimental and control group (n=24 for both groups). The control group only received argumentation instruction, while the experimental group received explicit idea-centered collaborative argumentation (CA) instruction (focusing on both argumentation instruction and collaboration nature of argumentation). Then, the two groups of students were asked to participate in KB-based argumentation for four weeks, in which the control group was provided with original KB-based openers in the KF while the experimental group was provided with CA-based openers additionally. Data was mainly from students’ online activities log files in KF. By analyzing the students’ knowledge building and collaborative argumentation behavioral patterns, this study found that these two groups of students revealed different collaborative learning behavior patterns. However, the students in the experimental group benefited more in both their knowledge building and collaborative argumentation from the proper adoption of knowledge building pedagogies and explicit idea-centered collaborative argumentation instruction in online SSI-based argumentation learning activities.","Wang, Li-Jen",12,1,Wang L.

Perhaps surprisingly, pairs with the highest quality solutions also expressed more uncertainty than the middle performers. Examining the ways in which students expressed and then followed up on uncertainty revealed that higher-performing pairs utilized emerging learning opportunities when uncertainty was expressed, and remained focused on one task at a time. In contrast, the lower-performing pairs often did not resolve their uncertainty before moving on, attempting to work with multiple incomplete pieces of the solution simultaneously. These findings provide insight into how best to support collaborative learning during uncertainty.","Price, Kimberly Michelle",24,1,Price K. M.

Educational tools are trying to harness sharing as a potential tool to engage students in learning processes. But, does sharing lead to an improvement in academic performance? The present study investigates the role of instant sharing in the context of learning in a classroom setting. Two groups of students, from a suburban school in Mumbai, India, played an arithmetic game over a period of 7-8 months. The experimental group played on a platform that supported instant sharing, while the platform for the control group was standalone. All other aspects of both platforms were same. Analysis of process data of the two groups reveals that instant sharing increased engagement with the game. Students from control group lost interest in the game after some days, while experimental group students remained active on it till the end of the four-month period.","Agrawal, Harshit",16,1,Agrawal H.

We anchor our claims in a case example of a cognitive ethnography of an introductory undergraduate history course. We describe how the ways in which learners self-organized and created practices for producing, sharing and reproducing knowledge in the course inform our design of CSCL tools for cultivating historical reasoning practices. This approach identifies points of contact between pre-existing practices and collaborative structures and pedagogical considerations. This enables designers to infuse pedagogical innovations into the activities that local participants already value and perform, achieving benefits akin to participatory design approaches. This can be productive for building on local practices that may be difficult to elicit through design discussions, especially if these local practices are part of learners’ counterculture.

By “innovation networks” we mean networks that go beyond sharing and discussion to the actual creation of new knowledge and innovations. Self-organization and emergence surround us, all the time and at multiple levels, whether we are aware or not. However, self-organization around idea improvement is rare and requires engaging innovative capacity at all levels, a research-intensive enterprise surrounding innovations, and an open source engineering team committed to enabling new forms of interaction, media, and analytic tools. “Multi-level” envisions inclusion of students, teachers, administrators, researchers, engineers, and policy makers in a collaborative enterprise.

Furthermore, we do not know what supports teachers themselves say that they need to teach about complex systems in their classrooms. In this study, we present a curriculum and instruction framework that outlines how teaching and learning about complex systems in high school science classroom contexts can be done.

SGIs place students’ ideas at the center of learning designs, considering the learning process as well as the learning goals/outcomes. By soliciting and foregrounding students’ diversified ideas in the classroom and beyond, the learning environment communicates to students that their ideas matter to others and that they have a position of responsibility to their own and their peers’ learning processes. The notion of SGIs is embodied in a repertoire of studies at the Learning Sciences Lab, National Institute of Education, Singapore, that offer varied yet overlapping interpretations of how student ideas can inform the design of learning contexts. In sharing the core design principles for SGIs approaches, this work contributes important components to the learning sciences discipline and changing educational practice.","Bielaczyc, Katerine",19,7,Bielaczyc K.

We also address how we analyze the specific material features of tools that co-determine the unfolding of the activities.

Furthermore, we do not know what supports teachers themselves say that they need to teach about complex systems in their classrooms. In this study, we present a curriculum and instruction framework that outlines how teaching and learning about complex systems in high school science classroom contexts can be done. We articulate the features of the framework and provide examples of how the framework is translated into practice. We follow with evidence from an exploratory study conducted with 10 teachers and over 300 students aimed at understanding change in teachers’ instructional practices; the extent to which students learned from the activities; what teachers’ perceptions were in terms of utility and usability; and what other supports teachers needed.

One approach for facilitating social interaction is small group collaboration. Successfully implementing small group collaboration in online courses, however, is not an easy task. In two iterations of a large online course, we first identified implementation problems and their possible causes (Course 1: N = 270), and subsequently tested possibilities of mitigation and corresponding improvements (Course 2: N = 111). The problems identified in Course 1 included a high dropout rate, low participation in group work, and low course satisfaction. These are typical problems in large online courses. However, their significance increases when they occur in the context of small group collaboration. Changes on the structural but also on the social level in Course 2 improved course satisfaction, but did not lower dropout rate nor did it increase participation in group work.

Despite growing awareness in the CSCL community of the importance of design in teachers’ work, there has been very little empirical research on how such design is carried out, or how design for CSCL can be supported and improved through the provision of better design tools and design methods. The paper offers an analysis of the work of four pairs of designers in our Multi-Surface Design Studio. These four dyads were completing a design task we set them, while simultaneously learning how to make good use of the various personal and shared digital tools, display surfaces and other resources in the studio. From observational and interview data, we show how collaborative design for learning needs to be understood as a complex, multiply-situated activity, in which design problem-solving, tools and space usage depend on the fluent deployment of intuitive knowledge about mutual awareness, shared perception, information persistence and movement.

We articulate the features of the framework and provide examples of how the framework is translated into practice. We follow with evidence from an exploratory study conducted with 10 teachers and over 300 students aimed at understanding change in teachers’ instructional practices; the extent to which students learned from the activities; what teachers’ perceptions were in terms of utility and usability; and what other supports teachers needed.

CK facilitated the scaffolding of grade 5/6 students through phases of collaborative biodiversity (CK2) and astronomy (CK3) inquiry. Using tablets, students contributed to a community knowledge base that was publicly displayed on an interactive whiteboard (IWB). The IWB visualized the community’s idea flow, enabling learners to sort their ideas along socially-negotiated categories. Inquiry work done in the CK environment affected the knowledge work done in the face-to-face classroom discussions, and vice versa. We observed that teachers used an orchestration cycle of Reflect-Refocus-Release (3R) as a means of managing this blended learning environment. A comparison of teachers’ Reflect discourse structures between both iterations, indicate such patterns vary with inquiry task demands.

SGIs place students’ ideas at the center of learning designs, considering the learning process as well as the learning goals/outcomes. By soliciting and foregrounding students’ diversified ideas in the classroom and beyond, the learning environment communicates to students that their ideas matter to others and that they have a position of responsibility to their own and their peers’ learning processes. The notion of SGIs is embodied in a repertoire of studies at the Learning Sciences Lab, National Institute of Education, Singapore, that offer varied yet overlapping interpretations of how student ideas can inform the design of learning contexts. In sharing the core design principles for SGIs approaches, this work contributes important components to the learning sciences discipline and changing educational practice.","Tan, Michael",12,6,Tan M.

Despite growing awareness in the CSCL community of the importance of design in teachers’ work, there has been very little empirical research on how such design is carried out, or how design for CSCL can be supported and improved through the provision of better design tools and design methods. The paper offers an analysis of the work of four pairs of designers in our Multi-Surface Design Studio. These four dyads were completing a design task we set them, while simultaneously learning how to make good use of the various personal and shared digital tools, display surfaces and other resources in the studio. From observational and interview data, we show how collaborative design for learning needs to be understood as a complex, multiply-situated activity, in which design problem-solving, tools and space usage depend on the fluent deployment of intuitive knowledge about mutual awareness, shared perception, information persistence and movement.

In this study, we present a curriculum and instruction framework that outlines how teaching and learning about complex systems in high school science classroom contexts can be done.

One approach for facilitating social interaction is small group collaboration. Successfully implementing small group collaboration in online courses, however, is not an easy task. In two iterations of a large online course, we first identified implementation problems and their possible causes (Course 1: N = 270), and subsequently tested possibilities of mitigation and corresponding improvements (Course 2: N = 111). The problems identified in Course 1 included a high dropout rate, low participation in group work, and low course satisfaction. These are typical problems in large online courses. However, their significance increases when they occur in the context of small group collaboration. Changes on the structural but also on the social level in Course 2 improved course satisfaction, but did not lower dropout rate nor did it increase participation in group work. ","Hoppe, H.

We further use the notion of keys (Goffman, 1974) to examine how the students construct distinct participation frameworks (Goodwin, 1993) within the two activity designs, and how this organization of activity may impact their learning experience.

The goal of this paper is to illustrate how well-coordinated groups establish and sustain joint visual attention by unpacking their different strategies and behaviors. Our data was collected in a dual eye-tracking setup where dyads of students (N=54) had to interact with a Tangible User Interface (TUI). We selected two groups of students displaying high levels of joint visual attention and compared them using cross-recurrence graphs displaying moments of joint attention from the eye-tracking data, speech data, and by qualitatively analyzing videos generated for that purpose. We found that greater insights can be found by augmenting cross-recurrence graphs with spatial and verbal data, and that high levels of joint visual attention can hide a free-rider effect (Salomon & Globerson, 1989). We conclude by discussing implications for automatically analyzing students’ interactions using dual eye-trackers.","Pea, Roy",8,5,Pea R.

Structured tasks let students practice problem-solving procedures step-by-step. Educational technology has mostly relied on providing only either task type, with a majority of learning environments focusing on structured tasks. We investigated in two quasi-experimental studies with 8-10 years old students from UK (N = 121) and 10-12 years old students from Germany (N = 151) whether a combination of both task types fosters robust knowledge more than structured tasks alone. Results confirmed this hypothesis and indicate that students learning with a combination of tasks gained more conceptual knowledge and equal procedural knowledge compared to students learning with structured tasks only.

To address these issues, we investigate the approach of embedding computational thinking content into required high school mathematics and science coursework. Using data from a 3-year implementation, we present results showing differences in attitudes towards computing by gender, while also finding similar gaps do not correlate with aptitude. Using pre/post measures, we then show female participants expressed improved confidence with computational thinking and interest in STEM careers.

Based on classroom observations, we identify five types of SGRs. Following the “perceive–interpret–mobilize” processing flow, teachers demonstrate three processing results (utilize, feedback, and abandon). Further, we identify three approaches of teachers’ utilization of SGRs and five approaches of their feedback to SGRs.

In this paper, we present a novel approach to segmenting data for the purposes of modeling connections in discourse. Specifically, we use epistemic network analysis to model connections in student discourse using a temporal segmentation method adapted from recent work in the learning sciences. We compare the results to a purely topic-based segmentation method to examine the affordances of temporal segmentation for modeling connections in discourse.","Shaffer, David Williamson",25,5,Shaffer D.

Despite growing awareness in the CSCL community of the importance of design in teachers’ work, there has been very little empirical research on how such design is carried out, or how design for CSCL can be supported and improved through the provision of better design tools and design methods. The paper offers an analysis of the work of four pairs of designers in our Multi-Surface Design Studio. These four dyads were completing a design task we set them, while simultaneously learning how to make good use of the various personal and shared digital tools, display surfaces and other resources in the studio. From observational and interview data, we show how collaborative design for learning needs to be understood as a complex, multiply-situated activity, in which design problem-solving, tools and space usage depend on the fluent deployment of intuitive knowledge about mutual awareness, shared perception, information persistence and movement.

We also compare the communication between these contexts in terms of their content focus, concentration of reasoning articulation, and the interaction between the two.  This comparison allows investigating the specific contribution of synchronous collaboration in a MOOC, which is relatively novel.  The analysis suggests that there is value in providing a diverse set of discussion contexts in that they may lend themselves to differently natured interactions, but that it creates a need for greater efforts towards effective bridging between media and channeling of students to pockets of interaction that are potentially of personal benefit.

This includes research on inquiry-based community learning, computer-mediated discourse analysis, participatory approaches to learning and assessment, and evidence-rich digital-credentials. In each of the four cases, the desire to extend that program of research to learning at scale resulted in significant advances in the more general program of research. In this way the symposium explores efforts to foster learning at scale might advance our theories of learning and our principles and methods for learning design more generally.","Håklev, Stian",13,5,Håklev S.

DALITE was designed around the principles of peer instruction, in particular, self-explanation and intentional reflection. DALITE consists of two databases: a database of college-level physics questions and another of student-generated rationales. We report on the iterative design process that has shaped this web-based asynchronous learning environment and on its use as part of an active learning pedagogy. Using mixed methods we have tested DALITE’s effectiveness to support conceptual change, examined the content of its databases, observed its use in classrooms, and conducted interviews from users – students as well as instructors. These data help to reveal the conditions of DALITE’s effectiveness. We discuss our findings and provide design guidelines.

It reports a study located in a novel multi-surface environment, configured to support small teams who are designing for other people’s learning. Despite growing awareness in the CSCL community of the importance of design in teachers’ work, there has been very little empirical research on how such design is carried out, or how design for CSCL can be supported and improved through the provision of better design tools and design methods. The paper offers an analysis of the work of four pairs of designers in our Multi-Surface Design Studio. These four dyads were completing a design task we set them, while simultaneously learning how to make good use of the various personal and shared digital tools, display surfaces and other resources in the studio. From observational and interview data, we show how collaborative design for learning needs to be understood as a complex, multiply-situated activity, in which design problem-solving, tools and space usage depend on the fluent deployment of intuitive knowledge about mutual awareness, shared perception, information persistence and movement.

Participants (N=54) worked in groups of two and solved optimization problems on the TinkerTable, a TUI designed for students in logistics. The TinkerTable features tangible shelves that students can manipulate to build and optimize the layout of a warehouse while the system provides feedback with a projector above the table. Using mobile eye-trackers, we examined participants’ visual coordination when solving those problems. We describe two contributions to the CSCL community: first, we propose a methodology for synchronizing two eye-tracking goggles and computing measures of joint visual attention (JVA) in a co-located setting. Second, we report preliminary findings suggesting that participants were more likely to have moments of joint attention when looking at 3D, realistic objects compared to 2D, abstract ones. JVA was also found to be a significant predictor of students’ learning gains and performance during the optimization tasks. We discuss implications of these findings for supporting interactions around a TUI.

In this exploratory study we were interested in understanding the extent to which students demonstrated understanding and skills in NGSS areas as they were designed. Evidence is gleaned from classroom observations and interviews with 50 students selected from the larger population of 352 students who worked with project resources during the 2013-2014 school year. Findings revealed that students demonstrated understanding and skills in all NGSS scientific practices and crosscutting themes particularly in the areas of developing and using models, analyzing and interpreting data, cause and effect, and systems and system models.

Our results show that the method commonly used by researchers to assess IRR produces unacceptable Type I error rates.","Shaffer, David Williamson",25,5,Shaffer D. W.

The new standards are a radical departure from previous standards in their focus on science practices. Not only have general notions of inquiry been replaced by specific science practices students should learn, but the standards articulate a vision of instruction that places student engagement in science practices as the means though which science concepts should be learned. Teacher educators recognize this shift places profound demands on teachers and teacher learning. We report evidence from the start of an NGSS professional development project on how teachers’ understanding of the science practices emerges from their efforts to re-design instruction to align with them. Our analysis suggests teachers’ initial understanding is quite far from the vision of NGSS. We characterize this understanding and consider its implications for teacher professional development.","Cournoyer, Nathan",17,2,Cournoyer N.

Our data was collected in a dual eye-tracking setup where dyads of students (N=54) had to interact with a Tangible User Interface (TUI). We selected two groups of students displaying high levels of joint visual attention and compared them using cross-recurrence graphs displaying moments of joint attention from the eye-tracking data, speech data, and by qualitatively analyzing videos generated for that purpose. We found that greater insights can be found by augmenting cross-recurrence graphs with spatial and verbal data, and that high levels of joint visual attention can hide a free-rider effect (Salomon & Globerson, 1989).

However, other mechanisms of PF have not yet been investigated in detail. Here, we focus on the role of communication patterns during the initial problem-solving phase. Using existing process data from a PF study, we investigated communication patterns based on the ICAP-model and correlated them with prior knowledge, quantity and quality of student solutions, and conceptual knowledge at post-test. Our findings suggest that interactive communication during the initial problem-solving phase only fosters conceptual knowledge if students discuss those ideas that particularly lend themselves to being contrasted with critical aspects of the correct solution during the subsequent instruction phase.","Loibl, Katharina",16,2,Loibl K.

Conceptual understanding and systems reasoning were assessed with pre- and post-test questionnaires. Learning processes were captured by analyzing their workbook writings. The L2C environment not only supported blind students’ learning similarly, but also furthered their learning with one of the more challenging concepts, diffusion.

The facilitators framed workgroup activity differently than the teachers; learning opportunities were limited when teachers were not able to engage the facilitators’ framings. But by introducing rich representations of practice, the facilitators attuned teachers’ attention to key conceptual resources. This scaffolded the workgroup into new forms of practice, thereby supporting teachers’ opportunities to learn more ambitious forms of professional practice.

Altogether, 1,538 students from 55 classes and involving 53 teachers participated in the study which ran from September 2014 to June 2015. Building upon four key SDL representation models, we first developed our three-dimensional SDL conceptual framework to guide our analysis of the specific leadership-, teacher-, and student-related factors that could foster SDL in science education.

Furthermore, students’ representational flexibility was correlated with their general learning performance when students’ interacted constructively and actively with representations but not when they interacted only actively with representations. In line with the ICAP-framework we conclude that active interactions trigger more intensively attending processes whereas constructive interactions trigger more intensively creating processes and are thus superior to the first kind of students’ cognitive engagement with multiple representations.

Using these four methods to analyze the discourse of a pair of students programming, we identified numerous examples of positioning shifts, and see how inequities could potentially emerge through discursive mechanisms.

We propose a computational model using ReaderBench that assesses collaboration from a dialogical perspective. Accordingly, collaboration emerges from the inter-twining of different points of view or, more specifically, from the inter-animation of voices pertaining to different speakers. Collaboration is determined from the intertwining or overlap of voices emitted by different participants throughout the ongoing conversation. This study presents a validation of this model consisting of a comparison between the output of our system and human evaluations of 10 chat conversations, selected from a corpus of more than 100 chats, in which Computer Science students debated on the advantages and disadvantages of CSCL technologies (e.g., chat, blog, wiki, forum, or Google Wave). The human evaluations of the degree of collaboration between the participants and the automated scores showed good overlap as measured by precision, recall, and F1 scores. Our overarching conclusion is that dialogism derived from the overlapping of voices can be perceived as a signature for collaboration.

The models are tested using data collected from a large US university. Specifically, while the predictive constructs are operationalized through the survey instruments, outcome measures are modeled using electronic trace data and actual evaluation information. Data is analyzed via the Partial Least Squares method. Results demonstrate close relatedness among the constructs and a different influencing mechanism on learning for each. The addition of social interaction as a factor to the learning model increases predictability of student learning as compared to models without this factor.

Despite growing awareness in the CSCL community of the importance of design in teachers’ work, there has been very little empirical research on how such design is carried out, or how design for CSCL can be supported and improved through the provision of better design tools and design methods. The paper offers an analysis of the work of four pairs of designers in our Multi-Surface Design Studio. These four dyads were completing a design task we set them, while simultaneously learning how to make good use of the various personal and shared digital tools, display surfaces and other resources in the studio. From observational and interview data, we show how collaborative design for learning needs to be understood as a complex, multiply-situated activity, in which design problem-solving, tools and space usage depend on the fluent deployment of intuitive knowledge about mutual awareness, shared perception, information persistence and movement.

In this study, we isolated the impact of structured guidance versus no guidance during a hands-on TUI activity on learning. In one condition, students rebuilt the hearing system by self-driven discovery; in another condition they rebuilt it by following the step-by-step instructions of a video-teacher. We found that the first group (“discover”) significantly outperformed the second group (“listen”) by ~27% on the final learning test.

To address this problem, we use the definitions from a recently proposed taxonomy to reclassify studies in the literature.  After reclassification, analysis of this literature reveals two main themes that illuminate how mixed instructional methods affect learning outcomes.

We examined scaffolding interactions of two symmetrical groups of students as they worked on physics simulations over time. We analyzed the interactions within each group to understand how students support their peers to learn science. We found that students in Group A had a significantly greater proportion of scaffolding discourse than students in Group B, but there were no significant differences in students’ learning gains between the two groups. However, we found that one student in each group emerged as a more dominant scaffolder by driving the discourse and helping the group move forward with the task; this student made the most learning gains in each group.

Sixty-seven students were randomly assigned to receive the feedback that either fit or did not fit their RF. Results revealed a significant interaction between an individual’s RF and the type of feedback received after controlling for the student’s prior achievement. In particular, the students demonstrated better performance when receiving the fit feedback than the non-fit feedback. Further analysis of different performing groups showed that this identified interaction was significant only for the middle performing students, but not for the lower or higher performing groups. The findings suggested that the student’s RF may moderate the impact of feedback on students’ statistics performance, and this moderation pans out differently depending on the student’s previous achievement.

Specifically we examine what happens when explicit attention and reflection is brought to students’ own gestures. Interviews were conducted with middle school students about their understanding of 3 critical science topics, and participants were frequently asked by the interviewer to “show me” when attempting to describe the unobservable mechanisms (e.g., molecular interactions) underlying observable phenomena. To understand the effects of prompting for gestures on student reasoning, we coded for whether explanations changed in response to these prompts compared to their previous explanations. Results showed that explicit attention to gesturing frequently led to increased attention and specification of mechanism. We describe a few specific cases to illustrate the ways in which gesturing seemed to alter student reasoning, and we describe design implications for computer simulations that are capable of using gestures as input.","Brown, David E.",15,2,Brown D.

Transferring research on the facilitation of complex cognitive skills from instructional design, two approaches may be effective: Fostering the constituents one by one respectively fostering them simultaneously. We therefore present an intervention study that takes a holistic approach on MA&P skills and their constituents, comparing a sequential (one-by-one) and an integrated (simultaneous) instructional approach to foster each constituent skill as well as students’ overall MA&P skills.

However, research supporting this stance has employed questions that could be considered to be teleologically-leading, suggesting a partially inaccurate view of children's tendency to provide teleological explanations. This paper compares a teleologically-leading treatment (what is X for?) with an open-treatment (why is there X?), finding that the leading-treatment resulted in significantly more teleological explanations that the open-treatment. This suggests children's proposed bias to provide teleological rationales about the natural world may be being overestimated. ","Oliver, Mary",12,2,Oliver M.

Learners experience difficulties with the involved processes and need guidance to design useful experiments. To guide students in this we created a configurable experiment design tool that is usable in multiple domains. The tool was tested with two configurations; one with a CVS structure in which learners had to design at least three experimental trials before conducting their experiment, and one in which this was not required. In the current study secondary students designed and conducted experiments in an online lab about buoyancy and Archimedes’ principle. Three conditions were compared in terms of students’ conceptual knowledge gain. Students worked with one configuration of the tool, or with no tool. Results showed significant differences between conditions for lower prior knowledge students’ learning gain about buoyancy.","Anjewierden, Anjo",17,2,Anjewierden A.

Results indicate that when students are less familiar with content or provided fewer details in other modes of communication, embodiment provides an alternative way to express their understanding.

We propose a computational model using ReaderBench that assesses collaboration from a dialogical perspective. Accordingly, collaboration emerges from the inter-twining of different points of view or, more specifically, from the inter-animation of voices pertaining to different speakers. Collaboration is determined from the intertwining or overlap of voices emitted by different participants throughout the ongoing conversation. This study presents a validation of this model consisting of a comparison between the output of our system and human evaluations of 10 chat conversations, selected from a corpus of more than 100 chats, in which Computer Science students debated on the advantages and disadvantages of CSCL technologies (e.g., chat, blog, wiki, forum, or Google Wave). The human evaluations of the degree of collaboration between the participants and the automated scores showed good overlap as measured by precision, recall, and F1 scores. Our overarching conclusion is that dialogism derived from the overlapping of voices can be perceived as a signature for collaboration.

This 2×2 field study (N=105) examines how Facebook can be harnessed for argumentative learning through group awareness tools and argumentation scripts. We measure domain-specific knowledge outcomes, the process of argumentative knowledge construction and attitude change. The results show a main effect for both conditions on domain-specific knowledge and argumentative knowledge construction, but no difference to the control group on attitude change.

In two quasi-experimental studies we investigated whether collaborative as compared to individual learning in PF leads to more learning. We also tested whether the beneficial PF effect could be replicated with much younger students, namely 4th and 5th graders, than previous studies. Only our first study replicated the PF effect.

The models are tested using data collected from a large US university. Specifically, while the predictive constructs are operationalized through the survey instruments, outcome measures are modeled using electronic trace data and actual evaluation information. Data is analyzed via the Partial Least Squares method. Results demonstrate close relatedness among the constructs and a different influencing mechanism on learning for each. The addition of social interaction as a factor to the learning model increases predictability of student learning as compared to models without this factor.

Our previous work suggests that TUIs are particularly good at preparing students for future learning; that is, students learn more when they can explore a novel domain with a TUI before compared to after receiving a traditional (e.g. lecture or text based) instruction. In this study, we isolated the impact of structured guidance versus no guidance during a hands-on TUI activity on learning. In one condition, students rebuilt the hearing system by self-driven discovery; in another condition they rebuilt it by following the step-by-step instructions of a video-teacher. We found that the first group (“discover”) significantly outperformed the second group (“listen”) by ~27% on the final learning test. To explain those results, we analyzed the TUI logs and explored how this effect unfolded with participants of different ability (i.e., low versus high GPA students).

In this paper we argue that the prevailing theoretical accounts block sight for important epistemic processes and also hinder a deeper understanding of the material qualities of use as they focus on the explication of what is known rather than on what is not known yet. Drawing on an ethnographic study in a design studio course on industrial design, we depict the use of design artifacts in a set of epistemic patterns. Based on the conclusion that these artifacts can be understood as objects used to come to terms with the unknown, we discuss potential implications for CSCL systems aimed to foster collaborative knowledge creation.

Specifically, we documented three cases of learners in an afterschool program called Kitchen Chemistry and their use of a social media app called ScienceKit. Analysis of ScienceKit data with facilitator interactions reveals a typology of learner paths across connected learning experiences.

Three dialog dimensions were identified: participants’ individual content-oriented contribution, social contribution, and their position within the social network. Hierarchical clusters built upon these dimensions reflect socio-cognitive structures including central, regular and peripheral OKC members. OKCs with a stronger layer of regular members appear more likely to integrate new members, whereas OKCs with a stronger layer of peripheral members appear less likely to do so.

CK facilitated the scaffolding of grade 5/6 students through phases of collaborative biodiversity (CK2) and astronomy (CK3) inquiry. Using tablets, students contributed to a community knowledge base that was publicly displayed on an interactive whiteboard (IWB). The IWB visualized the community’s idea flow, enabling learners to sort their ideas along socially-negotiated categories. Inquiry work done in the CK environment affected the knowledge work done in the face-to-face classroom discussions, and vice versa. We observed that teachers used an orchestration cycle of Reflect-Refocus-Release (3R) as a means of managing this blended learning environment. A comparison of teachers’ Reflect discourse structures between both iterations, indicate such patterns vary with inquiry task demands.

Based on emerging research from the more than 4000 young people that have participated in FUSE in 30+ schools, libraries, and summer camps in the Chicago area, we have begun to characterize how the affordances of the FUSE website are supporting a shift in the material organization of learning in the in-school classrooms in which it is implemented. We describe how FUSE ‘re-mediates’ learning by providing individualized learning pathways, dynamic arrangements for learning, alternative forms of ‘assessment’, new roles for the teacher, and a rethinking of how curriculum materials are produced.

Students might need to be facilitated to make sense of feedback and reflect more deeply on it. The study investigated the effect of sense-making support on revision skills and feedback uptake. Altogether, 73 university students were assigned to a condition either with or without sense-making support. Results showed no effect on revision skills, yet results of content-analysis yielded a significant effect for two out of three feedback uptake variables. Students in the condition with sense-making support made less new errors and rejected more incorrect feedback. Sense-making support appeared to help students to some extent to maximize benefit from peer-feedback.

Using mobile eye-trackers, we examined participants’ visual coordination when solving those problems. We describe two contributions to the CSCL community: first, we propose a methodology for synchronizing two eye-tracking goggles and computing measures of joint visual attention (JVA) in a co-located setting. Second, we report preliminary findings suggesting that participants were more likely to have moments of joint attention when looking at 3D, realistic objects compared to 2D, abstract ones. JVA was also found to be a significant predictor of students’ learning gains and performance during the optimization tasks. We discuss implications of these findings for supporting interactions around a TUI.

The results indicate that students participated in theorizing evenly in most knowledge building communities.","Khanlari, Ahmad",15,2,Khanlari A.

Literature has revealed that learners had difficulties in collaborative argumentation on SSIs. The use of knowledge building pedagogies may be helpful for facilitating students’ collaborative argumentation. To examine the perspective above, this study attempted to integrate the KB pedagogies in collaborative argumentation regarding SSIs. In this study, learners’ collaborative learning behavior patterns in the context of online argumentation learning activities were explored. The participants were 48 university students from two classes and were randomly divided into experimental and control group (n=24 for both groups). The control group only received argumentation instruction, while the experimental group received explicit idea-centered collaborative argumentation (CA) instruction (focusing on both argumentation instruction and collaboration nature of argumentation). Then, the two groups of students were asked to participate in KB-based argumentation for four weeks, in which the control group was provided with original KB-based openers in the KF while the experimental group was provided with CA-based openers additionally. Data was mainly from students’ online activities log files in KF. By analyzing the students’ knowledge building and collaborative argumentation behavioral patterns, this study found that these two groups of students revealed different collaborative learning behavior patterns. However, the students in the experimental group benefited more in both their knowledge building and collaborative argumentation from the proper adoption of knowledge building pedagogies and explicit idea-centered collaborative argumentation instruction in online SSI-based argumentation learning activities.","Cheng, Teng-Yao",15,2,Cheng T.

In a study of undergraduate novice computer science students working in pairs, we observed that the students who produced the lowest quality solutions expressed uncertainty more often than those who produced middle-quality solutions. Perhaps surprisingly, pairs with the highest quality solutions also expressed more uncertainty than the middle performers. Examining the ways in which students expressed and then followed up on uncertainty revealed that higher-performing pairs utilized emerging learning opportunities when uncertainty was expressed, and remained focused on one task at a time. In contrast, the lower-performing pairs often did not resolve their uncertainty before moving on, attempting to work with multiple incomplete pieces of the solution simultaneously. These findings provide insight into how best to support collaborative learning during uncertainty.","Boyer, Kristy Elizabeth",23,2,Boyer K. E.

One approach is to look at the physical aspects of how students collaborate while engaged in open-ended group-work during Practice-Based Learning (PBL) activities. By analysing how students and teachers move and interact in relation to each other, the space they are in and the objects within it, we can gain a greater understanding of the physical nature of collaborative group-work. This understanding can help us to create a learning environment that intrinsically but unobtrusively supports access by all user profiles who seek to engage with it, thus promoting equity of engagement and participation. Using the example of the design of a Learning Analytics System (LAS) and the educational furniture in which it is implemented, we will show how the physical design of a CSCL implementation can support increased collaboration.","Cukurova, Mutlu",15,2,Cukurova M.

The results from 190 students from an introductory programming class working in 95 pair-programming teams demonstrate that this simple modification to pair programming had a significant positive effect on test scores and on substantive contributions in collaborative dialogue.

Efforts in this direction are specifically promising in support of students’ self- and socially shared- regulation of their learning. Data on collaborative and metacognitive activities can inform collaborating groups and help them to improve future joint efforts.
