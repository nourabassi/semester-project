The analysis showed that CSCL research has mainly focused on design and implementation of technological and/or curricular interventions. Research questions influenced research methods to a degree, although the relationships were not strict. The results confirmed, as well as contradicted, some of the intuitive conceptions about the relationship between research questions and methods. Implications for future CSCL research are discussed.

The analysis shows two distinct ways of understanding the length of one meter, which primarily is visible through the children’s gesturing and bodily movement. In conclusion, the analysis shows that children dynamically produce body-material resources for communicative and illustrative purposes; moreover, they use body-material as a cognitive tool and as a way of shepherding the other.

The 57 studies that satisfied our search criteria were coded using a framework that considered the nature of the assessment intervention, the purposes of the assessment intervention, and the role of technology in student learning. This allowed us to identify four types of assessment interventions. The findings indicated that only interventions in the immersion orientation seemed to help students learn how to learn. Such assessment practices enabled students to learn actively and to learn both disciplinary substance and metacognitive/regulative skills. However, relatively few studies clearly integrated assessment and learning. The main contributions of this study are the coding framework and the four patterns of assessment interventions. Together, they provide a new way of thinking about the design of practice. The review provides guidance for the shift of assessment practice to scaffold learning of this field.

We propose a computational model using ReaderBench that assesses collaboration from a dialogical perspective. Accordingly, collaboration emerges from the inter-twining of different points of view or, more specifically, from the inter-animation of voices pertaining to different speakers. Collaboration is determined from the intertwining or overlap of voices emitted by different participants throughout the ongoing conversation. This study presents a validation of this model consisting of a comparison between the output of our system and human evaluations of 10 chat conversations, selected from a corpus of more than 100 chats, in which Computer Science students debated on the advantages and disadvantages of CSCL technologies (e.g., chat, blog, wiki, forum, or Google Wave). The human evaluations of the degree of collaboration between the participants and the automated scores showed good overlap as measured by precision, recall, and F1 scores. Our overarching conclusion is that dialogism derived from the overlapping of voices can be perceived as a signature for collaboration.

The models are tested using data collected from a large US university. Specifically, while the predictive constructs are operationalized through the survey instruments, outcome measures are modeled using electronic trace data and actual evaluation information. Data is analyzed via the Partial Least Squares method. Results demonstrate close relatedness among the constructs and a different influencing mechanism on learning for each. The addition of social interaction as a factor to the learning model increases predictability of student learning as compared to models without this factor.

Moreover we also proposed a collaborative add on activity to the learning material for the students to help them reflect on the material they learnt in the MOOC video. What comes out of the present study is two different interaction styles that differentiate the good students from the poor students. The good students engage with the teacher/collaborating partner through the interface/display. While the poor students engage with the material only. We name these two interaction styles as “looking through” and “looking at” respectively.

Further, the study explores how the digital learning resources create different conditions for social interaction and learning among students and their teacher in a classroom. The setting includes a class of 75 students (age 13–14) in two groups who receive identical instruction from their teacher. Field observations and pretests and posttests show that students playing the game are more engaged, yet their performance on posttests are significantly worse than the other group. Episodes of interaction between participants and technology suggest that they struggle with the symbolic world of the digital game, which constrains the mathematical meaning making that is relevant in schools.

The paper offers an analysis of the work of four pairs of designers in our Multi-Surface Design Studio. These four dyads were completing a design task we set them, while simultaneously learning how to make good use of the various personal and shared digital tools, display surfaces and other resources in the studio. From observational and interview data, we show how collaborative design for learning needs to be understood as a complex, multiply-situated activity, in which design problem-solving, tools and space usage depend on the fluent deployment of intuitive knowledge about mutual awareness, shared perception, information persistence and movement.

This method is illustrated by a simple proxy where a graduate student takes the place of a pilot apprentice who learns how to land an airplane in a computer simulation. Findings show that the SAN’s sociographs and the learning trajectory plot display the interconnected complexity of the learning that occurred at various forms of action as a result of participation.

Group members showed patterns in their discourse contributions in terms of content, function, and initiation and uptake of discourse topics. The emergence of these patterns stimulated role differentiation and stabilization. Conceptual discussion appeared to improve learning gains, while prioritization of task management detracted from learning. By tracking group discourse patterns, we can observe the process of role emergence in face-to-face CSCL interactions.

For this purpose, we built EarExplorer, an interactive tangible system where students can manipulate and connect parts of the auditory system to rebuild a functional structure. An augmented reality layer displays sound waves and shows how they are transformed at various stages of the process. Our previous work suggests that TUIs are particularly good at preparing students for future learning; that is, students learn more when they can explore a novel domain with a TUI before compared to after receiving a traditional (e.g. lecture or text based) instruction. In this study, we isolated the impact of structured guidance versus no guidance during a hands-on TUI activity on learning. In one condition, students rebuilt the hearing system by self-driven discovery; in another condition they rebuilt it by following the step-by-step instructions of a video-teacher. We found that the first group (“discover”) significantly outperformed the second group (“listen”) by ~27% on the final learning test. To explain those results, we analyzed the TUI logs and explored how this effect unfolded with participants of different ability (i.e., low versus high GPA students).

After reclassification, analysis of this literature reveals two main themes that illuminate how mixed instructional methods affect learning outcomes.

This comparison allows investigating the specific contribution of synchronous collaboration in a MOOC, which is relatively novel.  The analysis suggests that there is value in providing a diverse set of discussion contexts in that they may lend themselves to differently natured interactions, but that it creates a need for greater efforts towards effective bridging between media and channeling of students to pockets of interaction that are potentially of personal benefit.

Second, we report preliminary findings suggesting that participants were more likely to have moments of joint attention when looking at 3D, realistic objects compared to 2D, abstract ones. JVA was also found to be a significant predictor of students’ learning gains and performance during the optimization tasks. We discuss implications of these findings for supporting interactions around a TUI.

The analysis shows two distinct ways of understanding the length of one meter, which primarily is visible through the children’s gesturing and bodily movement.

This allowed us to identify four types of assessment interventions. The findings indicated that only interventions in the immersion orientation seemed to help students learn how to learn. Such assessment practices enabled students to learn actively and to learn both disciplinary substance and metacognitive/regulative skills. However, relatively few studies clearly integrated assessment and learning. The main contributions of this study are the coding framework and the four patterns of assessment interventions. Together, they provide a new way of thinking about the design of practice. The review provides guidance for the shift of assessment practice to scaffold learning of this field.

Accordingly, collaboration emerges from the inter-twining of different points of view or, more specifically, from the inter-animation of voices pertaining to different speakers. Collaboration is determined from the intertwining or overlap of voices emitted by different participants throughout the ongoing conversation. This study presents a validation of this model consisting of a comparison between the output of our system and human evaluations of 10 chat conversations, selected from a corpus of more than 100 chats, in which Computer Science students debated on the advantages and disadvantages of CSCL technologies (e.g., chat, blog, wiki, forum, or Google Wave). The human evaluations of the degree of collaboration between the participants and the automated scores showed good overlap as measured by precision, recall, and F1 scores. Our overarching conclusion is that dialogism derived from the overlapping of voices can be perceived as a signature for collaboration.

Preliminary evaluation of EduceBoard demonstrated that it allowed participants to play various roles in role-play and helped them reflect on their role-play from a variety of perspectives. In this paper, we also discuss how we can foster successful transfer of what they have learned to their self-performance in role-play or in real-life context.

We report on the iterative design process that has shaped this web-based asynchronous learning environment and on its use as part of an active learning pedagogy. Using mixed methods we have tested DALITE’s effectiveness to support conceptual change, examined the content of its databases, observed its use in classrooms, and conducted interviews from users – students as well as instructors.

The models are tested using data collected from a large US university. Specifically, while the predictive constructs are operationalized through the survey instruments, outcome measures are modeled using electronic trace data and actual evaluation information. Data is analyzed via the Partial Least Squares method. Results demonstrate close relatedness among the constructs and a different influencing mechanism on learning for each. The addition of social interaction as a factor to the learning model increases predictability of student learning as compared to models without this factor.

In taking action as the unit of analysis, persons, speech acts, and artifacts are considered as the nodes in a functional model of learning. This method is illustrated by a simple proxy where a graduate student takes the place of a pilot apprentice who learns how to land an airplane in a computer simulation. Findings show that the SAN’s sociographs and the learning trajectory plot display the interconnected complexity of the learning that occurred at various forms of action as a result of participation. Further work and limitations of this method are discussed.

Group members showed patterns in their discourse contributions in terms of content, function, and initiation and uptake of discourse topics. The emergence of these patterns stimulated role differentiation and stabilization. Conceptual discussion appeared to improve learning gains, while prioritization of task management detracted from learning.

In this study, we isolated the impact of structured guidance versus no guidance during a hands-on TUI activity on learning. In one condition, students rebuilt the hearing system by self-driven discovery; in another condition they rebuilt it by following the step-by-step instructions of a video-teacher.

Drawing on an ethnographic study in a design studio course on industrial design, we depict the use of design artifacts in a set of epistemic patterns.

Specifically, we documented three cases of learners in an afterschool program called Kitchen Chemistry and their use of a social media app called ScienceKit. Analysis of ScienceKit data with facilitator interactions reveals a typology of learner paths across connected learning experiences.

We found that students participating in an interdisciplinary learning community (LC) who implement their narratives collaboratively as a video game using computer programming produce better concept maps than students in a traditional English composition course.

We contend that these conflicting results are due to inconsistent or vague definitions of hybrid, blended, and flipped. To address this problem, we use the definitions from a recently proposed taxonomy to reclassify studies in the literature.  After reclassification, analysis of this literature reveals two main themes that illuminate how mixed instructional methods affect learning outcomes. Courses that use mixed methods can either reduce time in class and maintain learning outcomes or maintain time in class and improve learning outcomes.

We examined scaffolding interactions of two symmetrical groups of students as they worked on physics simulations over time. We analyzed the interactions within each group to understand how students support their peers to learn science. We found that students in Group A had a significantly greater proportion of scaffolding discourse than students in Group B, but there were no significant differences in students’ learning gains between the two groups. However, we found that one student in each group emerged as a more dominant scaffolder by driving the discourse and helping the group move forward with the task; this student made the most learning gains in each group.

Based on the approaches of voices interanimation and polyphony, a natural language processing tool was employed for dialog analysis in integrative vs. non-integrative blog-based OKCs. Three dialog dimensions were identified: participants’ individual content-oriented contribution, social contribution, and their position within the social network. Hierarchical clusters built upon these dimensions reflect socio-cognitive structures including central, regular and peripheral OKC members. OKCs with a stronger layer of regular members appear more likely to integrate new members, whereas OKCs with a stronger layer of peripheral members appear less likely to do so. Consequently, the study suggests an automated prediction method of OKC integrativity that may sustain the educational use of OKCs.

Altogether, 73 university students were assigned to a condition either with or without sense-making support. Results showed no effect on revision skills, yet results of content-analysis yielded a significant effect for two out of three feedback uptake variables.

After collaboration, however, it is not always clear what students internalize from this interaction. Even when students are aware of group-work benefits, effective collaboration does not necessarily occur spontaneously within the group context. To address this potential issue, the teacher can facilitate collaboration by modeling how to foster elaborative group discussions. In this paper, we evaluate how teacher modeling of collaboration prompts may increase the quantity and quality of concepts that students internalize before, during, and after collaboration. We found that students who did not observe modeling increased the quantity of connection on their post concept maps. In contrast, students who did receive modeling increased both the quantity and quality of their connections. This suggests that modeling of prompts before collaboration can deepen the internalization of concepts.

In this paper, I offer a set of pathways that characterize this work towards justice in the learning sciences, work which reflects a variety of means and ends. The pathways are: (1) Consider the goals of an equity-oriented framework for learning; (2) Theoretically, draw on existing critical social theory; (3) Methodologically, focus on collaborative change-making, and; (4) Support heterogeneity in knowing and doing. These pathways are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive, but rather provide an assessment of the current justice-oriented landscape in the learning sciences. I then argue that heterogeneity in means and ends towards addressing learning inequities is fruitful for the field and offer some open questions with which the critical learning sciences has yet to fully contend.

Quantitative analysis shows that students improved more on their understanding of discourse than comparison student and engaged in discourse that become more productive over time. Qualitative analyses reveal how the low-achieving students engage in the classroom meta-talk to deepen their understanding of progressive views of discourse and knowledge building.","Tong, Yuyao",11,0,Tong Y.

In this paper, we present our work with third and fourth graders to use an instructional design framework to involve children in a design and development project that includes coding but also other non-coding activities.

Through an overview of work conducted on the MOOCeology project it then shows specific ways that such concerns can be meaningfully addressed. The paper concludes by elucidating a set of seven initial principles for “learning sciences aware” EDS/LA work and opening the question of to what extent these principles might be appropriate to guide EDS/LA work more broadly.","Wise, Alyssa",12,0,Wise A.

Sociocultural research shows that collaboration affords nonverbal communication behaviors that helps students attend to visual features more quickly, which helps them acquire perceptual fluency. In contrast, cognitive research suggests that collaboration is ineffective for learning from simple tasks. Hence, we ask: Can collaboration via nonverbal communication enhance the acquisition of perceptual fluency? We investigated this question by examining how 10 dyads collaborate on simple perceptual tasks via nonverbal communication. We analyzed gestures and interviews about learning experiences. Further, we compared dyads’ performance on perceptual activities to 28 students who worked on the activities individually.

Ideally, online educational resources would constantly improve based on data and input from each learner, giving a better outcome for the next. This symposium explores issues around the use of crowdsourcing to harness learners’ interactions with resources like online problems and videos in order to improve these resources for the next learner. We hope to explore the benefits and limitations of thinking about learners through the lens of crowdsourcing, to imagine learnersourcing. We will discuss four ways in which researchers have leveraged crowdsourcing to help students learn in a variety of educational contexts, and in doing so we will also discuss ways in which educational theory can guide the future of learnersourcing.","Doroudi, Shayan",15,0,Doroudi S.

Beyond the similarities and differences between these methodologies, this scholarship also imagines new possibilities and orientations drawing on the two traditions – new roles for researchers and collaborators, alternative “argumentative grammars” (Kelly, 2004) underlying these approaches, and even new conceptions of learning itself. This symposium highlights the work of emerging scholars whose research employs variations of CHAT-inspired DBR in collaborative, community-grounded work oriented toward social change.

Thus, drawing may impede learning from a dynamic visualization when the target learning objective relates to dynamism as it may bias the learner to focus on structure at the expense of transformation.

Much of this research has focused on factors that affect team processes and outcomes, such as the use of team performance visualization tools. Such tools are also valuable to researchers who make inferences from team data or educators who assess teams and plan interventions. This variety of users suggests that studying these tools requires a user-centered approach focusing on affordance relationships. In this paper, we use Epistemic Network Analysis to create a visual representation of the space of affordance relationships for extant team performance visualization tools. We use this space to compare tools, and to demonstrate empirically the dimensions along which they differ. These dimensions suggest a preliminary taxonomy of tools in terms of their affordance relationships for different users. ","Swiecki, Zachari",16,0,Swiecki Z.

GCA calculates six inter- and intra-personal sociocognitive measures of such interactions and from these identify distinct interaction profiles through a cluster analysis. With this method, we were able to diagnostically reveal four robust profiles amongst MOOC learners.

This assumption, while historically reasonable, is likely to need reconsideration in the near future, as a variety of “transhumanist” technologies (enhanced senses, bodies, and internalized interfaces with the outside physical environment) become more prevalent in children’s lives. This paper discusses several foundational issues and questions that are poised to emerge, and to challenge our enduring ideas about children and education, in the foreseeable future.","Eisenberg, Michael",18,0,Eisenberg M.

In this pre-test/post-test quasi-experiment, middle school students played either a cooperative or competitive board game.

We also identified four clusters of resources that represent different ways of interacting with students’ contributions, with implications for responsiveness, learning, and equity.","Richards, Jennifer",18,0,Richards J.

I describe a specific tactic for teaching mathematics: to avoid using the word “thinking.” This approach is informed by scholarship on race, critical mathematics, and embodied cognition. I argue that using the term “thinking” is not necessary for facilitating authentic learning experiences. Moreover, this tactic disrupts a number of pernicious historical narratives (i.e., stereotypes) about mathematics education and about who can and who cannot do mathematics. The crux of the paper is that avoiding the word “thinking”—and other terms associated with “smartness”—loosens the grip Cartesian epistemology has on mathematics education by shifting classroom discourse away from math-as-thinking to math-as-action, which may, in turn, create stronger opportunities for learning. From a learning-sciences perspective, I present other hypotheses stemming out of this pedagogical approach that warrant further research. ","Gutiérrez, José",15,0,Gutiérrez J.

Qualitative data from written-reflections, semi-structured interviews and recorded audio-video observations were collected and compared to an ordinal ranking of groups’ collaborative instruction. Content analysis indicated pre-service perceptions of past collaborative experiences could be characterized as either a flexible orientation toward collaboration or an inflexible orientation toward collaboration. Discourse analysis indicated that pre-service perceptions of past collaborative experiences impacted students’ current collaborative efforts and outcomes. Students with a flexible orientation collaborated with higher quality interactions than students with an inflexible orientation.

A possible solution is to offer MOOC participants the opportunity to engage in collaborative activities. However, small-group collaboration in MOOCS poses several challenges which may reduce the beneficial effects of collaboration and reduce participants’ satisfaction with both the collaboration process and the course. In this work-in-progress paper, we describe the development of a library of typical problems that may occur during online collaboration in asynchronous, text-based online settings. The library covers the following aspects of collaboration: communication, joint information processing, coordination, and reciprocal interaction. The library was generated in a process by combining a top-down literature search and a bottom-up identification of typical problems in existing collaboration data. The library will be used as a basis for developing intelligent support for student collaboration in online courses.","Strauß, Sebastian",17,0,Strauß S.

Second, the child-centeredness of play points to possibilities for equitable mathematics instruction. We conceptualize problem solving in construction play as the process children engage in when they experience trouble accomplishing a goal and work to repair it. To examine this phenomenon, we used head-mounted GoPros to collect 348 point-of-view videos of children as they played in a mathematical playground, where “messing around” with designed objects provided them with opportunities to encounter mathematical concepts. Through a close examination of one case, we illustrate the mathematical generativity of play with the designed objects and argue that children’s construction play can support rich opportunities for children’s mathematical sensemaking.","Jasien, Lara",12,0,Jasien L.

To understand if this decision is helping learners from historically underrepresented populations succeed in computing classes, this paper presents an analysis of over 5,000 students answering questions presented in both block-based and text-based modalities.

The design of the collaborative version was motivated by noted benefits of collaborative learning including heightened retention of underrepresented students, particularly as demonstrated through pair programming within the CS domain. In this paper, we examine the outcome of two designs of the collaborative system with varying degrees of collaboration feedback. In the unstructured version, pairs are presented with no collaboration feedback while in the semistructured version of the system, pairs are given visual feedback in regards to their group and individual performance.  We collected log data of system use as well as audio recordings of pairs. We found that students in both conditions experienced significant learning gains. Shifts in dialogue initiative where significantly positively correlated to learning gains in both conditions. However, students provided with additional collaboration feedback, exhibited less planning and overall symmetry.","Harsley, Rachel",15,0,Harsley R.

The analysis focuses on how their engagement in the development of a collaborative platform for teacher learning started a journey of socio-technical co-evolution that resulted in exponential scaling of the innovation both qualitatively and quantitatively. The evolution trajectory of this network shows characteristics and susceptibilities similar to those in the socio-technical innovation literature.","Law, Nancy",10,0,Law N.

Challenges and goals were measured using a modified version of AIRE (Järvenoja, Volet, & Järvelä, 2013). Using a mixed methods exploratory approach, preliminary results showed that teams whose members (a) interacted with more positive social-emotional interactions (b) reported more team-oriented goals, and (c) had prior familiarity with each other, reached higher levels of mutual trust and shared mental models.

Perhaps surprisingly, pairs with the highest quality solutions also expressed more uncertainty than the middle performers. Examining the ways in which students expressed and then followed up on uncertainty revealed that higher-performing pairs utilized emerging learning opportunities when uncertainty was expressed, and remained focused on one task at a time.

Through the use of multimodal learning analytics platform, we collected various streams of data, processed and extracted multimodal interactions to answer the following question: which features of MMLA are good predictors of collaborative problem-solving in open-ended tasks in project-based learning? Manual entered scores of CPS were regressed using machine-learning methods.

While the strategy prompts did not have any significant influence, the verbalization prompts had versatile effects: On one hand, quality of talk was improved, on the other hand, task focus and emotions were negatively affected. Learning gains were limited to near transfer task types and comparable over conditions.","Schmitt, Lara Johanna",21,0,Schmitt L. J.

Second, collaboration often involves multiple visual representations. But many students have difficulties in making sense of representations. Educational technologies can support students in doing so by adapting to how they construct, interpret, and connect representations. We conducted a quasi-experiment with 61 undergraduate chemistry students to test the effectiveness of an adaptive collaboration script that prompts students to discuss visual representations. A control condition collaboratively solved worksheet problems with multiple visual representations without a collaboration script. An experimental condition solved the same problems using an educational technology with the script.

The analysis shows two distinct ways of understanding the length of one meter, which primarily is visible through the children’s gesturing and bodily movement.

The 57 studies that satisfied our search criteria were coded using a framework that considered the nature of the assessment intervention, the purposes of the assessment intervention, and the role of technology in student learning. This allowed us to identify four types of assessment interventions. The findings indicated that only interventions in the immersion orientation seemed to help students learn how to learn. Such assessment practices enabled students to learn actively and to learn both disciplinary substance and metacognitive/regulative skills. However, relatively few studies clearly integrated assessment and learning. The main contributions of this study are the coding framework and the four patterns of assessment interventions. Together, they provide a new way of thinking about the design of practice. The review provides guidance for the shift of assessment practice to scaffold learning of this field.

We propose a computational model using ReaderBench that assesses collaboration from a dialogical perspective. Accordingly, collaboration emerges from the inter-twining of different points of view or, more specifically, from the inter-animation of voices pertaining to different speakers. Collaboration is determined from the intertwining or overlap of voices emitted by different participants throughout the ongoing conversation. This study presents a validation of this model consisting of a comparison between the output of our system and human evaluations of 10 chat conversations, selected from a corpus of more than 100 chats, in which Computer Science students debated on the advantages and disadvantages of CSCL technologies (e.g., chat, blog, wiki, forum, or Google Wave). The human evaluations of the degree of collaboration between the participants and the automated scores showed good overlap as measured by precision, recall, and F1 scores. Our overarching conclusion is that dialogism derived from the overlapping of voices can be perceived as a signature for collaboration.

By tracing the growth of vocabulary extracted from specific word lists, we found that the growth rate for different types of words varied across each year but correlated with each other.

Based on social cognitive theory, this study proposes two dynamic CSCL models of learning using understudied factors – system functionality, social ability, collective efficacy and social interaction – to examine mediation and causal relationships among these constructs and their influence on learning. The models are tested using data collected from a large US university. Specifically, while the predictive constructs are operationalized through the survey instruments, outcome measures are modeled using electronic trace data and actual evaluation information. Data is analyzed via the Partial Least Squares method. Results demonstrate close relatedness among the constructs and a different influencing mechanism on learning for each. The addition of social interaction as a factor to the learning model increases predictability of student learning as compared to models without this factor. The paper concludes with discussion of the implications of this study.

These four dyads were completing a design task we set them, while simultaneously learning how to make good use of the various personal and shared digital tools, display surfaces and other resources in the studio. From observational and interview data, we show how collaborative design for learning needs to be understood as a complex, multiply-situated activity, in which design problem-solving, tools and space usage depend on the fluent deployment of intuitive knowledge about mutual awareness, shared perception, information persistence and movement.

For this purpose, we built EarExplorer, an interactive tangible system where students can manipulate and connect parts of the auditory system to rebuild a functional structure. An augmented reality layer displays sound waves and shows how they are transformed at various stages of the process. Our previous work suggests that TUIs are particularly good at preparing students for future learning; that is, students learn more when they can explore a novel domain with a TUI before compared to after receiving a traditional (e.g. lecture or text based) instruction. In this study, we isolated the impact of structured guidance versus no guidance during a hands-on TUI activity on learning. In one condition, students rebuilt the hearing system by self-driven discovery; in another condition they rebuilt it by following the step-by-step instructions of a video-teacher. We found that the first group (“discover”) significantly outperformed the second group (“listen”) by ~27% on the final learning test. To explain those results, we analyzed the TUI logs and explored how this effect unfolded with participants of different ability (i.e., low versus high GPA students).

After reclassification, analysis of this literature reveals two main themes that illuminate how mixed instructional methods affect learning outcomes. Courses that use mixed methods can either reduce time in class and maintain learning outcomes or maintain time in class and improve learning outcomes.

The analysis suggests that there is value in providing a diverse set of discussion contexts in that they may lend themselves to differently natured interactions, but that it creates a need for greater efforts towards effective bridging between media and channeling of students to pockets of interaction that are potentially of personal benefit.

Participants (N=54) worked in groups of two and solved optimization problems on the TinkerTable, a TUI designed for students in logistics. The TinkerTable features tangible shelves that students can manipulate to build and optimize the layout of a warehouse while the system provides feedback with a projector above the table. Using mobile eye-trackers, we examined participants’ visual coordination when solving those problems. We describe two contributions to the CSCL community: first, we propose a methodology for synchronizing two eye-tracking goggles and computing measures of joint visual attention (JVA) in a co-located setting. Second, we report preliminary findings suggesting that participants were more likely to have moments of joint attention when looking at 3D, realistic objects compared to 2D, abstract ones. JVA was also found to be a significant predictor of students’ learning gains and performance during the optimization tasks. We discuss implications of these findings for supporting interactions around a TUI.

This allowed us to identify four types of assessment interventions. The findings indicated that only interventions in the immersion orientation seemed to help students learn how to learn. Such assessment practices enabled students to learn actively and to learn both disciplinary substance and metacognitive/regulative skills. However, relatively few studies clearly integrated assessment and learning. The main contributions of this study are the coding framework and the four patterns of assessment interventions.

Collaboration is determined from the intertwining or overlap of voices emitted by different participants throughout the ongoing conversation. This study presents a validation of this model consisting of a comparison between the output of our system and human evaluations of 10 chat conversations, selected from a corpus of more than 100 chats, in which Computer Science students debated on the advantages and disadvantages of CSCL technologies (e.g., chat, blog, wiki, forum, or Google Wave). The human evaluations of the degree of collaboration between the participants and the automated scores showed good overlap as measured by precision, recall, and F1 scores.

DALITE consists of two databases: a database of college-level physics questions and another of student-generated rationales. We report on the iterative design process that has shaped this web-based asynchronous learning environment and on its use as part of an active learning pedagogy. Using mixed methods we have tested DALITE’s effectiveness to support conceptual change, examined the content of its databases, observed its use in classrooms, and conducted interviews from users – students as well as instructors. These data help to reveal the conditions of DALITE’s effectiveness. We discuss our findings and provide design guidelines.

The models are tested using data collected from a large US university. Specifically, while the predictive constructs are operationalized through the survey instruments, outcome measures are modeled using electronic trace data and actual evaluation information. Data is analyzed via the Partial Least Squares method. Results demonstrate close relatedness among the constructs and a different influencing mechanism on learning for each. The addition of social interaction as a factor to the learning model increases predictability of student learning as compared to models without this factor.

We investigated how group discourse shaped emergent roles in a collaborative small group over the course of a 12-week science curriculum with simulated science experiments. Group members showed patterns in their discourse contributions in terms of content, function, and initiation and uptake of discourse topics. The emergence of these patterns stimulated role differentiation and stabilization. Conceptual discussion appeared to improve learning gains, while prioritization of task management detracted from learning. By tracking group discourse patterns, we can observe the process of role emergence in face-to-face CSCL interactions.

In this study, we isolated the impact of structured guidance versus no guidance during a hands-on TUI activity on learning. In one condition, students rebuilt the hearing system by self-driven discovery; in another condition they rebuilt it by following the step-by-step instructions of a video-teacher. We found that the first group (“discover”) significantly outperformed the second group (“listen”) by ~27% on the final learning test.

However, there is no consensus on the actual roles these artifacts are playing in processes of (collaborative) knowledge creation. In this paper we argue that the prevailing theoretical accounts block sight for important epistemic processes and also hinder a deeper understanding of the material qualities of use as they focus on the explication of what is known rather than on what is not known yet. Drawing on an ethnographic study in a design studio course on industrial design, we depict the use of design artifacts in a set of epistemic patterns. Based on the conclusion that these artifacts can be understood as objects used to come to terms with the unknown, we discuss potential implications for CSCL systems aimed to foster collaborative knowledge creation.

In this study, we shed light on how we can initiate the process of connected learning through technology-realized and facilitator-based scaffolding of learners’ interests, social interactions, and scientific inquiry pursuits. Specifically, we documented three cases of learners in an afterschool program called Kitchen Chemistry and their use of a social media app called ScienceKit. Analysis of ScienceKit data with facilitator interactions reveals a typology of learner paths across connected learning experiences. Furthermore, understanding typologies that best match each learner appears to be critical for helping learners to make connections across interest-driven and peer-supported scientific inquiry.

After reclassification, analysis of this literature reveals two main themes that illuminate how mixed instructional methods affect learning outcomes. Courses that use mixed methods can either reduce time in class and maintain learning outcomes or maintain time in class and improve learning outcomes.

Three dialog dimensions were identified: participants’ individual content-oriented contribution, social contribution, and their position within the social network. Hierarchical clusters built upon these dimensions reflect socio-cognitive structures including central, regular and peripheral OKC members. OKCs with a stronger layer of regular members appear more likely to integrate new members, whereas OKCs with a stronger layer of peripheral members appear less likely to do so.

A possible solution might be to offer adaptable argumentation scripts that allow students to adjust the script to their own needs. This study compares the effects of three argumentation scripts (high structured vs. low structured vs. adaptable) on students’ argumentation skills. Furthermore, we investigate to what extent students’ self-regulation skills influence the acquisition of argumentation skills in the three conditions. N = 109 math students were randomized to the three treatment conditions and worked in dyads on mathematical proof tasks in a CSCL environment. Students’ argumentation skills increased between pre- and post-tests with comparable gains in all three conditions. Only for students learning with the adaptable argumentation script, self-regulation skills were a significant positive predictor for argumentation skills.

First, we identified pivotal points of discourse where students might engage in an epistemic action toward alleviating a lack of knowledge. Then, we conducted in-depth analysis of discourse segments around the pivotal points. Results revealed that pivotal points identified by SNA were confirmed as alleviating lack of knowledge by further in-depth dialogical analysis.

After collaboration, however, it is not always clear what students internalize from this interaction. Even when students are aware of group-work benefits, effective collaboration does not necessarily occur spontaneously within the group context. To address this potential issue, the teacher can facilitate collaboration by modeling how to foster elaborative group discussions. In this paper, we evaluate how teacher modeling of collaboration prompts may increase the quantity and quality of concepts that students internalize before, during, and after collaboration. We found that students who did not observe modeling increased the quantity of connection on their post concept maps. In contrast, students who did receive modeling increased both the quantity and quality of their connections. This suggests that modeling of prompts before collaboration can deepen the internalization of concepts.

Using answer sequence data from three Khan Academy exercises, we generate high-dimensional vector representations of incorrect student answers using a model of distributed representation more commonly applied to natural language. After clustering wrong answers in the learned vector space, we use these clusters as the basis for analysis of student misconceptions with a quantitative comparison to manual coding and a deeper qualitative discussion based on a constructivist framework. The result is a demonstration of how big data from conventional tutoring systems can act as a bridge to more critical pedagogies from the learning sciences via a distributed, connectionist model of student concept formation.","Farrar, Scott",13,1,Farrar S.

This paper investigated to what extent such problems are caused by inadequate evidence-based reasoning scripts that guide teachers in the way they tackle pedagogical problems. We investigated the scripts of N = 103 beginning and N = 236 advanced pre-service teachers by asking them to analyze fictitious, but realistic problem cases in an open-answer format. Afterwards, they were asked to describe the cognitive activities they engaged in during problem analysis. Results showed that advanced students more often than beginners reported to engage in problem identification, while beginners more often reported to engage in goal-setting. Furthermore, students’ attitudes towards research on learning and instruction positively predicted their engagement in these cognitive activities. Thus, it appears that the evidence-based reasoning scripts of both beginning and advanced pre-service teachers might benefit from scaffolding, as well as supportive motivational-affective factors.","Kollar, Ingo",12,1,Kollar I.

Through a mixed methods approach, we engage various stakeholders in identifying and describing important problems of practice, work to specify the inherent contradictions that often exist in those challenges, and, by confronting those contradictions, initiate a process of innovation rooted in the contexts in which students, teachers, leaders, and parents learn and work.","Haines, Cara",12,1,Haines C.

The discrepancy in these findings has been attributed to the differences between drawing and dynamic visualizations. While dynamic visualizations emphasize spatiotemporal transformations, drawing emphasizes static spatiotemporal structures. Thus, drawing may impede learning from a dynamic visualization when the target learning objective relates to dynamism as it may bias the learner to focus on structure at the expense of transformation. Here, we present our developing findings that drawing provides an effective learning scaffold for learning from dynamic visualizations more so than self-explanation prompts, and that drawing biases learners to attend to fewer spatiotemporal structures.

Where extraneous/non-reflective strategies occur, we suggest that teachers be made aware of the tendency toward this kind of group decision making and that greater emphasis be placed on optimal evidence use through active modeling.","Park, Miyoung",13,1,Park M.

Our study shows how integrating the equity-oriented design approach, community ethnography as pedagogy, as a part of teaching and learning STEM, supports the emergences of making present practices: modeling ethnographic data, re-performing injustices towards understanding and solidarity, and making change dynamic and visible in classroom work. These practices and their implications are described using ethnographic data from 6 urban middle school classrooms in two states during a STEM unit focused on engineering for sustainable communities.","Tan, Edna Tan",13,1,Tan E.

Students’ disciplinary engagement is not only dependent on how they author, share or convince others of their ideas, but also how such practices invoke issues of power.

Through task-based studies with first-grade children, we examine the design affordances of a tangible user interface, Project Bloks. For the scope of this paper, we focus on two coding puzzles where children engage with loops. Our findings reveal that the design affordances of the system are conducive to the learning of loops, and highlight some difficulties that children encounter with loops.

In contrast, GCA makes use of linguistic cohesion analysis across sequences of learners’ interactions in multi-party communication. GCA calculates six inter- and intra-personal sociocognitive measures of such interactions and from these identify distinct interaction profiles through a cluster analysis. With this method, we were able to diagnostically reveal four robust profiles amongst MOOC learners.

While the importance of collaboration is often identified as crucial to successful project-based learning activities, there is not much empirical work that describes: a) what these collaborations look like and b) what happens for learners as they engage in collaborative activities. Here, we draw on data from three different studies of maker-based activities to explore the following question: What forms of collaboration are made possible in maker activities? In asking how collaboration develops through making we shift from collaboration as a design feature of learning environments to both a process and an outcome of learning. We take up an emergent perspective on collaboration focusing on the collaborative interactions that occur naturalistically in maker activities. ","Litts, Breanne K",16,1,Litts B. K.

We find strong evidence that the female condition induces strong positive effects on overall course activity and discussion posting behavior by female students, but also strong evidence of a smaller negative effect on these outcomes for male students. We find no effect on students’ persistence through the course.

In what ways does relationality shape and become shaped by emergent ethical attunements in learning environments?  How might research and design that center the ethics of learning shift how “impact” is defined and assessed?","Jackson, Ava",12,1,Jackson A.

We asked: (1) What did third-graders' digital artifacts reveal about their use of multiple modes to communicate information? (2) How did students describe their modal use as they shared their digital artifacts? Findings suggest that third-graders were strategic and flexible in their modal selection and use.

This symposium assembles four papers that offer various ways regarding the measurement of prerequisites and processes of such regulatory efforts during group learning. The presented methods range from Likert-scale self-report questionnaires over video case vignettes towards an analysis of real group processes by aid of logfiles and discourse coding schemes. These methods will be critically discussed, especially in terms of their transferability to studying collaborative learning in diverse educational contexts, both formal and informal.

While several types of IP systems have become available, none offer tracking of multiple agents that balances high accuracy with low cost. This paper highlights new 3D IP technology designed for educational contexts, which coordinates as few as 4 and as many as 80 physical “tags.” The tags act both as anchors to delineate the play space and as trackers that send high-accuracy location data to a server in real time that can later be played back. To test the impact of the technology on learning, we compared it to a parallel non-IP environment that approximates locations between two points in classroom settings. Findings indicate that the IP technology enhances engagement with systems thinking concepts through more robust reflection on movements and actions compared to the non-IP environment.","Thompson, Naomi",15,1,Thompson N.

Critically, the Area-Algebra and Arithmetic-Algebra sequences had the largest learning effects, with the former better for participants with some prior knowledge of 2D × 2D multiplication and the latter better for participants with no prior knowledge. All sequences also produced improvements on unpracticed transfer problems, with the Area-Algebra sequence producing the largest learning effects. Finally, improvements were most associated with prior knowledge of single-digit addition and subtraction – but not multiplication – facts. The implications of these results are discussed and future directions outlined.","Varma, Sashank",14,1,Varma S.

This paper examines how adult mentors in a nationally recognized U.S. public library makerspace, who are mentoring racially and socioeconomically diverse teens, conceptualize their practice. We present an analysis of semi-structured interviews with these mentors, which proceded from a broader study that also included participant observation of makerspace activity and focal interviews of participating youth.

Data collection included baseline data, questionnaires investigating students’ immersion and learning gains, as well as post-activity interviews. Findings showed higher learning gains and increased immersion for the students participating in the strong coupling condition than for the students in the loose coupling condition.

The museum is the Baba Nyonya Heritage Museum in Malacca, Malaysia. We created a number of public interactive installations designed to facilitate inter-cultural and inter-generational dialogues about cultural identity. The technology employed mixed and augmented reality techniques and gesture recognition to enable visitors to have a multisensory experience with the artefacts on display. Analysis of pre- to post-test knowledge based surveys showed significant learning gains as a result of interacting with the exhibits. Surveys of visitors' attitudes showed that they felt they had benefitted from the physical interactivity. Qualitative analysis of observational and video data showed that the different interaction techniques provided both benefits and challenges for interaction, which we reflect upon in the paper.

To understand if this decision is helping learners from historically underrepresented populations succeed in computing classes, this paper presents an analysis of over 5,000 students answering questions presented in both block-based and text-based modalities. A comparative analysis shows that while all students perform better when questions are presented in the block-based form, female students and students from historically underrepresented minorities saw the largest improvements.

We frame learning as a collaborative practice where contributions are used to make arguments with different resources. Across both cases, materials and laminations of space-times (Leander, 2002) are used as: 1) evaluative resources, and 2) knowledge constructing resources for design. In this view of learning, the final product and performance are not only end goals but used as resources in the design process through laminations of imagined future space-times.","Radke, Sarah C",14,1,Radke S.

We discuss how, through mixing media, repurposing space, and remote assistance families make home “work” with technology.

This paper contributes to research on dynamic support for collaborative learning by proposing a novel form of micro-level prompt designed to elevate the amount of Transactive exchange.

To examine the perspective above, this study attempted to integrate the KB pedagogies in collaborative argumentation regarding SSIs.

The participants were 48 university students from two classes and were randomly divided into experimental and control group (n=24 for both groups). The control group only received argumentation instruction, while the experimental group received explicit idea-centered collaborative argumentation (CA) instruction (focusing on both argumentation instruction and collaboration nature of argumentation). Then, the two groups of students were asked to participate in KB-based argumentation for four weeks, in which the control group was provided with original KB-based openers in the KF while the experimental group was provided with CA-based openers additionally. Data was mainly from students’ online activities log files in KF. By analyzing the students’ knowledge building and collaborative argumentation behavioral patterns, this study found that these two groups of students revealed different collaborative learning behavior patterns. However, the students in the experimental group benefited more in both their knowledge building and collaborative argumentation from the proper adoption of knowledge building pedagogies and explicit idea-centered collaborative argumentation instruction in online SSI-based argumentation learning activities.","Wang, Li-Jen",12,1,Wang L.

Perhaps surprisingly, pairs with the highest quality solutions also expressed more uncertainty than the middle performers. Examining the ways in which students expressed and then followed up on uncertainty revealed that higher-performing pairs utilized emerging learning opportunities when uncertainty was expressed, and remained focused on one task at a time. In contrast, the lower-performing pairs often did not resolve their uncertainty before moving on, attempting to work with multiple incomplete pieces of the solution simultaneously. These findings provide insight into how best to support collaborative learning during uncertainty.","Price, Kimberly Michelle",24,1,Price K. M.

We propose a computational model using ReaderBench that assesses collaboration from a dialogical perspective. Accordingly, collaboration emerges from the inter-twining of different points of view or, more specifically, from the inter-animation of voices pertaining to different speakers. Collaboration is determined from the intertwining or overlap of voices emitted by different participants throughout the ongoing conversation. This study presents a validation of this model consisting of a comparison between the output of our system and human evaluations of 10 chat conversations, selected from a corpus of more than 100 chats, in which Computer Science students debated on the advantages and disadvantages of CSCL technologies (e.g., chat, blog, wiki, forum, or Google Wave). The human evaluations of the degree of collaboration between the participants and the automated scores showed good overlap as measured by precision, recall, and F1 scores. Our overarching conclusion is that dialogism derived from the overlapping of voices can be perceived as a signature for collaboration.

Based on social cognitive theory, this study proposes two dynamic CSCL models of learning using understudied factors – system functionality, social ability, collective efficacy and social interaction – to examine mediation and causal relationships among these constructs and their influence on learning. The models are tested using data collected from a large US university. Specifically, while the predictive constructs are operationalized through the survey instruments, outcome measures are modeled using electronic trace data and actual evaluation information. Data is analyzed via the Partial Least Squares method. Results demonstrate close relatedness among the constructs and a different influencing mechanism on learning for each. The addition of social interaction as a factor to the learning model increases predictability of student learning as compared to models without this factor.

These four dyads were completing a design task we set them, while simultaneously learning how to make good use of the various personal and shared digital tools, display surfaces and other resources in the studio. From observational and interview data, we show how collaborative design for learning needs to be understood as a complex, multiply-situated activity, in which design problem-solving, tools and space usage depend on the fluent deployment of intuitive knowledge about mutual awareness, shared perception, information persistence and movement.

We contend that these conflicting results are due to inconsistent or vague definitions of hybrid, blended, and flipped. To address this problem, we use the definitions from a recently proposed taxonomy to reclassify studies in the literature.  After reclassification, analysis of this literature reveals two main themes that illuminate how mixed instructional methods affect learning outcomes. Courses that use mixed methods can either reduce time in class and maintain learning outcomes or maintain time in class and improve learning outcomes.

This comparison allows investigating the specific contribution of synchronous collaboration in a MOOC, which is relatively novel.  The analysis suggests that there is value in providing a diverse set of discussion contexts in that they may lend themselves to differently natured interactions, but that it creates a need for greater efforts towards effective bridging between media and channeling of students to pockets of interaction that are potentially of personal benefit.

Thirty-seven online students, belonging to one of 13 teams, formed the participants of the study. Teams completed five discussion sessions as part of required course activity, using one of two reflective conditions. Each team also received feedback on their performance. We assessed the quality of processes between groups using content analysis techniques. Team process measures at the first time point were used to identify groups’ initial strengths and weaknesses. To assess the utility of the model and reflective assessment designs, we used a 2x5 mixed factorial design, with Condition (two levels) as a between subjects factor and Time (5 levels) as a within subjects factor. We found that students were weakest at presenting and discussing claims and both Condition and Time are significant predictors of collaborative process quality.

Furthermore, computer-supported learning activities that rely upon embodiment may be best evaluated with measures that allow students to continue to embody their knowledge during assessments. Our study presents early efforts to understand how embodiment might support or hinder 2nd graders’ expressions of states of matter (N=18). Results indicate that when students are less familiar with content or provided fewer details in other modes of communication, embodiment provides an alternative way to express their understanding. Moreover, the intervention familiarized students with how to use embodiment to express themselves which led students to yield responses which were just as nuanced as other modes of communication.

We propose a computational model using ReaderBench that assesses collaboration from a dialogical perspective. Accordingly, collaboration emerges from the inter-twining of different points of view or, more specifically, from the inter-animation of voices pertaining to different speakers. Collaboration is determined from the intertwining or overlap of voices emitted by different participants throughout the ongoing conversation. This study presents a validation of this model consisting of a comparison between the output of our system and human evaluations of 10 chat conversations, selected from a corpus of more than 100 chats, in which Computer Science students debated on the advantages and disadvantages of CSCL technologies (e.g., chat, blog, wiki, forum, or Google Wave). The human evaluations of the degree of collaboration between the participants and the automated scores showed good overlap as measured by precision, recall, and F1 scores. Our overarching conclusion is that dialogism derived from the overlapping of voices can be perceived as a signature for collaboration.

The models are tested using data collected from a large US university. Specifically, while the predictive constructs are operationalized through the survey instruments, outcome measures are modeled using electronic trace data and actual evaluation information. Data is analyzed via the Partial Least Squares method. Results demonstrate close relatedness among the constructs and a different influencing mechanism on learning for each. The addition of social interaction as a factor to the learning model increases predictability of student learning as compared to models without this factor.

They had to prepare jointly for an upcoming negotiation via audio conference. In the condition with Preference Awareness, the priorities, which were stated by the team members afterwards, covered the preferences of all team members significantly better than in the condition without awareness.

Our previous work suggests that TUIs are particularly good at preparing students for future learning; that is, students learn more when they can explore a novel domain with a TUI before compared to after receiving a traditional (e.g. lecture or text based) instruction. In this study, we isolated the impact of structured guidance versus no guidance during a hands-on TUI activity on learning. In one condition, students rebuilt the hearing system by self-driven discovery; in another condition they rebuilt it by following the step-by-step instructions of a video-teacher. We found that the first group (“discover”) significantly outperformed the second group (“listen”) by ~27% on the final learning test.

In this paper we argue that the prevailing theoretical accounts block sight for important epistemic processes and also hinder a deeper understanding of the material qualities of use as they focus on the explication of what is known rather than on what is not known yet. Drawing on an ethnographic study in a design studio course on industrial design, we depict the use of design artifacts in a set of epistemic patterns. Based on the conclusion that these artifacts can be understood as objects used to come to terms with the unknown, we discuss potential implications for CSCL systems aimed to foster collaborative knowledge creation.

Specifically, we documented three cases of learners in an afterschool program called Kitchen Chemistry and their use of a social media app called ScienceKit. Analysis of ScienceKit data with facilitator interactions reveals a typology of learner paths across connected learning experiences.

Three dialog dimensions were identified: participants’ individual content-oriented contribution, social contribution, and their position within the social network. Hierarchical clusters built upon these dimensions reflect socio-cognitive structures including central, regular and peripheral OKC members. OKCs with a stronger layer of regular members appear more likely to integrate new members, whereas OKCs with a stronger layer of peripheral members appear less likely to do so.

CK facilitated the scaffolding of grade 5/6 students through phases of collaborative biodiversity (CK2) and astronomy (CK3) inquiry. Using tablets, students contributed to a community knowledge base that was publicly displayed on an interactive whiteboard (IWB). The IWB visualized the community’s idea flow, enabling learners to sort their ideas along socially-negotiated categories. Inquiry work done in the CK environment affected the knowledge work done in the face-to-face classroom discussions, and vice versa. We observed that teachers used an orchestration cycle of Reflect-Refocus-Release (3R) as a means of managing this blended learning environment. A comparison of teachers’ Reflect discourse structures between both iterations, indicate such patterns vary with inquiry task demands.

Based on emerging research from the more than 4000 young people that have participated in FUSE in 30+ schools, libraries, and summer camps in the Chicago area, we have begun to characterize how the affordances of the FUSE website are supporting a shift in the material organization of learning in the in-school classrooms in which it is implemented. We describe how FUSE ‘re-mediates’ learning by providing individualized learning pathways, dynamic arrangements for learning, alternative forms of ‘assessment’, new roles for the teacher, and a rethinking of how curriculum materials are produced.

Students might need to be facilitated to make sense of feedback and reflect more deeply on it. The study investigated the effect of sense-making support on revision skills and feedback uptake. Altogether, 73 university students were assigned to a condition either with or without sense-making support. Results showed no effect on revision skills, yet results of content-analysis yielded a significant effect for two out of three feedback uptake variables. Students in the condition with sense-making support made less new errors and rejected more incorrect feedback. Sense-making support appeared to help students to some extent to maximize benefit from peer-feedback.

We describe two contributions to the CSCL community: first, we propose a methodology for synchronizing two eye-tracking goggles and computing measures of joint visual attention (JVA) in a co-located setting. Second, we report preliminary findings suggesting that participants were more likely to have moments of joint attention when looking at 3D, realistic objects compared to 2D, abstract ones. JVA was also found to be a significant predictor of students’ learning gains and performance during the optimization tasks. We discuss implications of these findings for supporting interactions around a TUI.

To find an answer to this question, which could also be used for optimizing complementarity-based group formations, we have systematically varied learners’ knowledge levels relative to learning partners’ levels (continuous distance) and absolute levels of knowledge (three levels) in 33 visualizations to investigate associated question and explanation intentions. The results confirm a strong influence of distances on intentions, moderated by absolute knowledge levels.

This suggests that designers of technology for science inquiry need to be explicit about desired learning goals and forms of engagement.  ","Riedel-Kruse, Ingmar",20,2,Riedel-Kruse I.

Commonly used approaches in MOOCs derive insight into the learning processes from aggregated text or structural data. In contrast, GCA makes use of linguistic cohesion analysis across sequences of learners’ interactions in multi-party communication. GCA calculates six inter- and intra-personal sociocognitive measures of such interactions and from these identify distinct interaction profiles through a cluster analysis. With this method, we were able to diagnostically reveal four robust profiles amongst MOOC learners.

We show how conjecture mapping informed and supported our DBR work and how it helped push for specificity in hypothesized relations between the design, the learning setting, the outcomes, while also forcing a reflection on design constraints.","Phillips, Abigail Leigh",23,2,Phillips A.

We explored students’ use of epistemic criteria before and after the intervention. We found that students were able to generate and use a variety of epistemic criteria even before the intervention. Yet they improved in their ability to invoke fit-with-evidence as an epistemic criterion, a central criterion in modeling and argumentation. Our data suggest that students developed in their understanding of which criteria are prioritized in scientific practice—i.e., a meta-epistemic understanding of the utility and importance of epistemic criteria.","Duncan, Ravit Golan",19,2,Duncan R.

The study was conducted with 382 4th and 5th grade students. Students across all three conditions had significant learning gains. However, the combined condition had higher learning gains than the individual or collaborative condition. This difference was more pronounced for 4th grade students than for 5th grade students. In addition, we found that students in the combined condition expressed higher situational interest in the activity compared to those working individually and the same as students working only collaboratively.

To examine the perspective above, this study attempted to integrate the KB pedagogies in collaborative argumentation regarding SSIs. In this study, learners’ collaborative learning behavior patterns in the context of online argumentation learning activities were explored. The participants were 48 university students from two classes and were randomly divided into experimental and control group (n=24 for both groups). The control group only received argumentation instruction, while the experimental group received explicit idea-centered collaborative argumentation (CA) instruction (focusing on both argumentation instruction and collaboration nature of argumentation). Then, the two groups of students were asked to participate in KB-based argumentation for four weeks, in which the control group was provided with original KB-based openers in the KF while the experimental group was provided with CA-based openers additionally. Data was mainly from students’ online activities log files in KF. By analyzing the students’ knowledge building and collaborative argumentation behavioral patterns, this study found that these two groups of students revealed different collaborative learning behavior patterns. However, the students in the experimental group benefited more in both their knowledge building and collaborative argumentation from the proper adoption of knowledge building pedagogies and explicit idea-centered collaborative argumentation instruction in online SSI-based argumentation learning activities.","Cheng, Teng-Yao",15,2,Cheng T.

Perhaps surprisingly, pairs with the highest quality solutions also expressed more uncertainty than the middle performers. Examining the ways in which students expressed and then followed up on uncertainty revealed that higher-performing pairs utilized emerging learning opportunities when uncertainty was expressed, and remained focused on one task at a time. In contrast, the lower-performing pairs often did not resolve their uncertainty before moving on, attempting to work with multiple incomplete pieces of the solution simultaneously. These findings provide insight into how best to support collaborative learning during uncertainty.","Boyer, Kristy Elizabeth",23,2,Boyer K. E.

Accordingly, collaboration emerges from the inter-twining of different points of view or, more specifically, from the inter-animation of voices pertaining to different speakers. Collaboration is determined from the intertwining or overlap of voices emitted by different participants throughout the ongoing conversation. This study presents a validation of this model consisting of a comparison between the output of our system and human evaluations of 10 chat conversations, selected from a corpus of more than 100 chats, in which Computer Science students debated on the advantages and disadvantages of CSCL technologies (e.g., chat, blog, wiki, forum, or Google Wave). The human evaluations of the degree of collaboration between the participants and the automated scores showed good overlap as measured by precision, recall, and F1 scores. Our overarching conclusion is that dialogism derived from the overlapping of voices can be perceived as a signature for collaboration.

Analysis of lexical proficiency based on Lexical Frequency Profile and P_Lex indicated significant growth in productive written vocabulary, especially for words beyond the first two 1,000 word lists. By tracing the growth of vocabulary extracted from specific word lists, we found that the growth rate for different types of words varied across each year but correlated with each other. Correlation analyses between these lexical measures and Knowledge Building behavioral indicators revealed that note revisions are the strongest predictor of vocabulary growth rate, whereas note reading is related with lexical proficiency measures.

Despite growing awareness in the CSCL community of the importance of design in teachers’ work, there has been very little empirical research on how such design is carried out, or how design for CSCL can be supported and improved through the provision of better design tools and design methods. The paper offers an analysis of the work of four pairs of designers in our Multi-Surface Design Studio. These four dyads were completing a design task we set them, while simultaneously learning how to make good use of the various personal and shared digital tools, display surfaces and other resources in the studio. From observational and interview data, we show how collaborative design for learning needs to be understood as a complex, multiply-situated activity, in which design problem-solving, tools and space usage depend on the fluent deployment of intuitive knowledge about mutual awareness, shared perception, information persistence and movement.

We propose a computational model using ReaderBench that assesses collaboration from a dialogical perspective. Accordingly, collaboration emerges from the inter-twining of different points of view or, more specifically, from the inter-animation of voices pertaining to different speakers. Collaboration is determined from the intertwining or overlap of voices emitted by different participants throughout the ongoing conversation. This study presents a validation of this model consisting of a comparison between the output of our system and human evaluations of 10 chat conversations, selected from a corpus of more than 100 chats, in which Computer Science students debated on the advantages and disadvantages of CSCL technologies (e.g., chat, blog, wiki, forum, or Google Wave). The human evaluations of the degree of collaboration between the participants and the automated scores showed good overlap as measured by precision, recall, and F1 scores. Our overarching conclusion is that dialogism derived from the overlapping of voices can be perceived as a signature for collaboration.

Despite growing awareness in the CSCL community of the importance of design in teachers’ work, there has been very little empirical research on how such design is carried out, or how design for CSCL can be supported and improved through the provision of better design tools and design methods. The paper offers an analysis of the work of four pairs of designers in our Multi-Surface Design Studio. These four dyads were completing a design task we set them, while simultaneously learning how to make good use of the various personal and shared digital tools, display surfaces and other resources in the studio. From observational and interview data, we show how collaborative design for learning needs to be understood as a complex, multiply-situated activity, in which design problem-solving, tools and space usage depend on the fluent deployment of intuitive knowledge about mutual awareness, shared perception, information persistence and movement.

We refer to these, respectively, as the study of ambient, naturally occurring, environments, and of designed environments. We present a set of seven studies that demonstrate the strong potential for the cross-fostering of ideas between educational scientists, who focus on the interventionist design-based study of learning, and social scientists, who focus on the analytic study of ambient social interaction and knowledge construction. Each study demonstrates specific insights regarding lessons that can be learned from the ambient to the designed arena, and vice versa, using lenses that integrate our various disciplinary research perspectives.

Drawing on an ethnographic study in a design studio course on industrial design, we depict the use of design artifacts in a set of epistemic patterns.

The analysis suggests that there is value in providing a diverse set of discussion contexts in that they may lend themselves to differently natured interactions, but that it creates a need for greater efforts towards effective bridging between media and channeling of students to pockets of interaction that are potentially of personal benefit.

Three dialog dimensions were identified: participants’ individual content-oriented contribution, social contribution, and their position within the social network. Hierarchical clusters built upon these dimensions reflect socio-cognitive structures including central, regular and peripheral OKC members. OKCs with a stronger layer of regular members appear more likely to integrate new members, whereas OKCs with a stronger layer of peripheral members appear less likely to do so. Consequently, the study suggests an automated prediction method of OKC integrativity that may sustain the educational use of OKCs.

Thus, drawing may impede learning from a dynamic visualization when the target learning objective relates to dynamism as it may bias the learner to focus on structure at the expense of transformation. Here, we present our developing findings that drawing provides an effective learning scaffold for learning from dynamic visualizations more so than self-explanation prompts, and that drawing biases learners to attend to fewer spatiotemporal structures.

Few studies use control groups or comprehensively use analytic data collected by social media platforms. We highlight opportunities for scaling K-12 learning with social media globally and call for educators to engage more with social media developers and owners. With this overview, we offer an agenda for future learning sciences research, policy, practice and commercial development in this growing field. ","Greenhow, Christine",19,3,Greenhow C.

We find that peer tutors in high-rapport dyads offer more help and prompt their tutees to explain their reasoning more than low-rapport dyads, with tutees in such dyads verbalizing their problem-solving process and proposing more steps and answers. Meanwhile, rapport is associated with increased procedural performance, but tutees’ self-efficacy and prior knowledge moderate the effect of rapport on tutees’ conceptual performance.","Cassell, Justine",16,3,Cassell J.

In sharing presentations, there was variability in students' descriptions of multimodal features and rationale for modal use. ","Soloway, Elliot",15,3,Soloway E.

This symposium assembles four papers that offer various ways regarding the measurement of prerequisites and processes of such regulatory efforts during group learning. The presented methods range from Likert-scale self-report questionnaires over video case vignettes towards an analysis of real group processes by aid of logfiles and discourse coding schemes. These methods will be critically discussed, especially in terms of their transferability to studying collaborative learning in diverse educational contexts, both formal and informal.

We explored students’ use of epistemic criteria before and after the intervention. We found that students were able to generate and use a variety of epistemic criteria even before the intervention. Yet they improved in their ability to invoke fit-with-evidence as an epistemic criterion, a central criterion in modeling and argumentation.

Contrary to some previous findings, all pairs in both conditions were found to work together (rather than in parallel / competitively) the entire time. The general finding is a somewhat limited, but consistent, positive effect of the assigned roles/tools manipulation on collaborative processes.

Despite growing awareness in the CSCL community of the importance of design in teachers’ work, there has been very little empirical research on how such design is carried out, or how design for CSCL can be supported and improved through the provision of better design tools and design methods. The paper offers an analysis of the work of four pairs of designers in our Multi-Surface Design Studio. These four dyads were completing a design task we set them, while simultaneously learning how to make good use of the various personal and shared digital tools, display surfaces and other resources in the studio. From observational and interview data, we show how collaborative design for learning needs to be understood as a complex, multiply-situated activity, in which design problem-solving, tools and space usage depend on the fluent deployment of intuitive knowledge about mutual awareness, shared perception, information persistence and movement.

Despite growing awareness in the CSCL community of the importance of design in teachers’ work, there has been very little empirical research on how such design is carried out, or how design for CSCL can be supported and improved through the provision of better design tools and design methods. The paper offers an analysis of the work of four pairs of designers in our Multi-Surface Design Studio. These four dyads were completing a design task we set them, while simultaneously learning how to make good use of the various personal and shared digital tools, display surfaces and other resources in the studio. From observational and interview data, we show how collaborative design for learning needs to be understood as a complex, multiply-situated activity, in which design problem-solving, tools and space usage depend on the fluent deployment of intuitive knowledge about mutual awareness, shared perception, information persistence and movement.

Based on the approaches of voices interanimation and polyphony, a natural language processing tool was employed for dialog analysis in integrative vs. non-integrative blog-based OKCs. Three dialog dimensions were identified: participants’ individual content-oriented contribution, social contribution, and their position within the social network. Hierarchical clusters built upon these dimensions reflect socio-cognitive structures including central, regular and peripheral OKC members. OKCs with a stronger layer of regular members appear more likely to integrate new members, whereas OKCs with a stronger layer of peripheral members appear less likely to do so.

CK facilitated the scaffolding of grade 5/6 students through phases of collaborative biodiversity (CK2) and astronomy (CK3) inquiry. Using tablets, students contributed to a community knowledge base that was publicly displayed on an interactive whiteboard (IWB). The IWB visualized the community’s idea flow, enabling learners to sort their ideas along socially-negotiated categories. Inquiry work done in the CK environment affected the knowledge work done in the face-to-face classroom discussions, and vice versa. We observed that teachers used an orchestration cycle of Reflect-Refocus-Release (3R) as a means of managing this blended learning environment. A comparison of teachers’ Reflect discourse structures between both iterations, indicate such patterns vary with inquiry task demands.

The TinkerTable features tangible shelves that students can manipulate to build and optimize the layout of a warehouse while the system provides feedback with a projector above the table. Using mobile eye-trackers, we examined participants’ visual coordination when solving those problems. We describe two contributions to the CSCL community: first, we propose a methodology for synchronizing two eye-tracking goggles and computing measures of joint visual attention (JVA) in a co-located setting. Second, we report preliminary findings suggesting that participants were more likely to have moments of joint attention when looking at 3D, realistic objects compared to 2D, abstract ones. JVA was also found to be a significant predictor of students’ learning gains and performance during the optimization tasks. We discuss implications of these findings for supporting interactions around a TUI.

In this paper, we present a fully autonomous robot for middle school math; we iterate through three design phases and analyze responses to identify how to better foster productive social experiences for self-efficacy.

Through participation in an after-school program and/or summer internship, high school students used Arduino-compatible hardware and software to develop their own scientific instruments for use in classroom physics laboratories. Here we present findings on students’ roles as co-designers and how that influenced their learning and engagement. Furthermore, we discuss issues of accessibility in designing activities in terms of physical and computational affordances. Regardless of prior experience, students were more engaged using pre-assembled robots with defined projects compared with materials and methods traditionally utilized in makerspaces. Additionally, the graphical programming language associated with these robots was more accessible than script-based languages generally used to program Arduinos. This suggests, that to provide equitable access to -- and engagement with -- electronic making, more material and computational scaffolding are required than what is generally provided in conventional makerspaces for implementation in high school classes.","Vondracek, Mark",15,4,Vondracek M.

This highlights the need for carefully designed assessments targeting the integration of science and CT to help teachers and researchers gauge students’ proficiency with integrating the disciplines. We describe a principled design process to develop assessment tasks and rubrics that integrate concepts and practices across science, CT, and computational modeling. We conducted a pilot study with 10 high school students who responded to integrative assessment tasks as part of a physics-based computational modeling unit. Our findings indicate that the tasks and rubrics successfully elicit both Physics and CT constructs while distinguishing important aspects of proficiency related to the two disciplines.

A classroom study revealed that the effect of tangible puppetry role-play remained in the immediate transfer task; the participants could elicit a variety of voices from possible pupils even in the self-performed role-play, and they did not lose such perspective immediately on their essay.

These four dyads were completing a design task we set them, while simultaneously learning how to make good use of the various personal and shared digital tools, display surfaces and other resources in the studio. From observational and interview data, we show how collaborative design for learning needs to be understood as a complex, multiply-situated activity, in which design problem-solving, tools and space usage depend on the fluent deployment of intuitive knowledge about mutual awareness, shared perception, information persistence and movement.

We describe two contributions to the CSCL community: first, we propose a methodology for synchronizing two eye-tracking goggles and computing measures of joint visual attention (JVA) in a co-located setting. Second, we report preliminary findings suggesting that participants were more likely to have moments of joint attention when looking at 3D, realistic objects compared to 2D, abstract ones. JVA was also found to be a significant predictor of students’ learning gains and performance during the optimization tasks. We discuss implications of these findings for supporting interactions around a TUI.

Despite growing awareness in the CSCL community of the importance of design in teachers’ work, there has been very little empirical research on how such design is carried out, or how design for CSCL can be supported and improved through the provision of better design tools and design methods. The paper offers an analysis of the work of four pairs of designers in our Multi-Surface Design Studio. These four dyads were completing a design task we set them, while simultaneously learning how to make good use of the various personal and shared digital tools, display surfaces and other resources in the studio. From observational and interview data, we show how collaborative design for learning needs to be understood as a complex, multiply-situated activity, in which design problem-solving, tools and space usage depend on the fluent deployment of intuitive knowledge about mutual awareness, shared perception, information persistence and movement.

We also compare the communication between these contexts in terms of their content focus, concentration of reasoning articulation, and the interaction between the two.  This comparison allows investigating the specific contribution of synchronous collaboration in a MOOC, which is relatively novel.  The analysis suggests that there is value in providing a diverse set of discussion contexts in that they may lend themselves to differently natured interactions, but that it creates a need for greater efforts towards effective bridging between media and channeling of students to pockets of interaction that are potentially of personal benefit.

Yet, argumentation scripts run the danger of overscripting students’ argumentation. A possible solution might be to offer adaptable argumentation scripts that allow students to adjust the script to their own needs. This study compares the effects of three argumentation scripts (high structured vs. low structured vs. adaptable) on students’ argumentation skills. Furthermore, we investigate to what extent students’ self-regulation skills influence the acquisition of argumentation skills in the three conditions. N = 109 math students were randomized to the three treatment conditions and worked in dyads on mathematical proof tasks in a CSCL environment. Students’ argumentation skills increased between pre- and post-tests with comparable gains in all three conditions. Only for students learning with the adaptable argumentation script, self-regulation skills were a significant positive predictor for argumentation skills.

CK facilitated the scaffolding of grade 5/6 students through phases of collaborative biodiversity (CK2) and astronomy (CK3) inquiry. Using tablets, students contributed to a community knowledge base that was publicly displayed on an interactive whiteboard (IWB). The IWB visualized the community’s idea flow, enabling learners to sort their ideas along socially-negotiated categories. Inquiry work done in the CK environment affected the knowledge work done in the face-to-face classroom discussions, and vice versa. We observed that teachers used an orchestration cycle of Reflect-Refocus-Release (3R) as a means of managing this blended learning environment. A comparison of teachers’ Reflect discourse structures between both iterations, indicate such patterns vary with inquiry task demands.

Using mobile eye-trackers, we examined participants’ visual coordination when solving those problems. We describe two contributions to the CSCL community: first, we propose a methodology for synchronizing two eye-tracking goggles and computing measures of joint visual attention (JVA) in a co-located setting. Second, we report preliminary findings suggesting that participants were more likely to have moments of joint attention when looking at 3D, realistic objects compared to 2D, abstract ones. JVA was also found to be a significant predictor of students’ learning gains and performance during the optimization tasks. We discuss implications of these findings for supporting interactions around a TUI.

These four dyads were completing a design task we set them, while simultaneously learning how to make good use of the various personal and shared digital tools, display surfaces and other resources in the studio. From observational and interview data, we show how collaborative design for learning needs to be understood as a complex, multiply-situated activity, in which design problem-solving, tools and space usage depend on the fluent deployment of intuitive knowledge about mutual awareness, shared perception, information persistence and movement.

Efforts in this direction are specifically promising in support of students’ self- and socially shared- regulation of their learning.

It reports a study located in a novel multi-surface environment, configured to support small teams who are designing for other people’s learning. Despite growing awareness in the CSCL community of the importance of design in teachers’ work, there has been very little empirical research on how such design is carried out, or how design for CSCL can be supported and improved through the provision of better design tools and design methods. The paper offers an analysis of the work of four pairs of designers in our Multi-Surface Design Studio. These four dyads were completing a design task we set them, while simultaneously learning how to make good use of the various personal and shared digital tools, display surfaces and other resources in the studio. From observational and interview data, we show how collaborative design for learning needs to be understood as a complex, multiply-situated activity, in which design problem-solving, tools and space usage depend on the fluent deployment of intuitive knowledge about mutual awareness, shared perception, information persistence and movement.

Furthermore, we do not know what supports teachers themselves say that they need to teach about complex systems in their classrooms. In this study, we present a curriculum and instruction framework that outlines how teaching and learning about complex systems in high school science classroom contexts can be done. We articulate the features of the framework and provide examples of how the framework is translated into practice.

Our collective focus is on identifying aspects of evidentiary knowledge and reasoning that prevail in scientific practice but are typically absent from classroom implementations of inquiry in science education. Further, the symposium will address sources of challenge for teachers and students as they engage with evidence in the science classroom and discuss ways in which educators can scaffold the development of more sophisticated reasoning with and about evidence.","Chinn, Clark",12,6,Chinn C.

This symposium assembles four papers that offer various ways regarding the measurement of prerequisites and processes of such regulatory efforts during group learning. The presented methods range from Likert-scale self-report questionnaires over video case vignettes towards an analysis of real group processes by aid of logfiles and discourse coding schemes. These methods will be critically discussed, especially in terms of their transferability to studying collaborative learning in diverse educational contexts, both formal and informal. That way, the symposium will significantly expand previous methods for the assessment of self-, co- and shared regulation during collaborative learning.","Greisel, Martin",15,6,Greisel M.

Efforts in this direction are specifically promising in support of students’ self- and socially shared- regulation of their learning. Data on collaborative and metacognitive activities can inform collaborating groups and help them to improve future joint efforts.

This symposium presents four contemporary case studies in which video is used innovatively to investigate mathematics learning experiences in three different countries (US, UK, Italy).

This symposium draws together scholarship operating within the Knowledge Analysis tradition to investigate reasoning and learning in domains outside of STEM classroom subjects. In doing so, each paper explores the affordances and limitations of Knowledge Analysis to shed light on significant questions in their respective domains of knowledge, including: restorative justice practices, the ethics of drone warfare, undergraduate course design, and urban planning. By further expanding the use of Knowledge Analysis to include non-STEM subjects, we hope to raise important questions and offer richer and more generalizable views of knowledge and learning relevant to both STEM and non-STEM domains.

In this paper, we explore Markov chain principles in a time-based probabilistic graphical approach to analyze a multi-year data set of log data generated by students from one urban middle school and coded using a framework aligned with 21st century learning activities. Results showed the efficacy of applying Markov chain principles in helping reveal similar and distinct usage patterns of the learners in this community across different time spans. This work has implications for the design and analysis of online learning platforms and for creating opportunities to help youth build 21st century skills using online learning platforms.","MacArthur, Chris",16,7,MacArthur C.

We follow with evidence from an exploratory study conducted with 10 teachers and over 300 students aimed at understanding change in teachers’ instructional practices; the extent to which students learned from the activities; what teachers’ perceptions were in terms of utility and usability; and what other supports teachers needed.

We present a set of seven studies that demonstrate the strong potential for the cross-fostering of ideas between educational scientists, who focus on the interventionist design-based study of learning, and social scientists, who focus on the analytic study of ambient social interaction and knowledge construction. Each study demonstrates specific insights regarding lessons that can be learned from the ambient to the designed arena, and vice versa, using lenses that integrate our various disciplinary research perspectives.

Efforts in this direction are specifically promising in support of students’ self- and socially shared- regulation of their learning. Data on collaborative and metacognitive activities can inform collaborating groups and help them to improve future joint efforts.

In contrast, work in learning analytics attempts to leverage the collection and analysis of data to improve learning processes and outcomes in-situ. Developing learning analytics to support CSCL thus offers the opportunity to make our research actionable in an immediate way by using data collected on collaborative processes in-progress to inform their future trajectories. Efforts in this direction are specifically promising in support of students’ self- and socially shared- regulation of their learning. Data on collaborative and metacognitive activities can inform collaborating groups and help them to improve future joint efforts. In this symposium we bring together a collection of five papers that are exploring the space of connection between CSCL, learning analytics and self-regulation to advance thinking around these issues.

A recent special issue of the Journal of the Learning Sciences was dedicated to exploring “CHAT/DBR” from multiple perspectives (Penuel, Cole & O’Neill, 2016). Beyond the similarities and differences between these methodologies, this scholarship also imagines new possibilities and orientations drawing on the two traditions – new roles for researchers and collaborators, alternative “argumentative grammars” (Kelly, 2004) underlying these approaches, and even new conceptions of learning itself. This symposium highlights the work of emerging scholars whose research employs variations of CHAT-inspired DBR in collaborative, community-grounded work oriented toward social change. The session offers innovative perspectives on how we conceptualize learning; rethinking design in our methods; what constitutes a learning environment; and rethinking relationships among researchers, partners, learners and interventions.","Jurow, A.
