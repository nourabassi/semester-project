These tasks support bothsteered and creative role-playing, collaborative design, and virtual gameplay among the targetchildren. Nine 10-14-year-old children with high functioning autism participated in the studyover 16-31 intervention sessions. A time-series, seasonal index analysis was conducted withparticipants’ longitudinal social interaction performance during and across various VRlearning tasks. The study findings indicated that the design features of the simulated scenariosand learning tasks in the VR-based learning environment mediated the intervention effects ondifferent social interaction performance.IntroductionPrevalence rates suggest that 1 in 68 American children are diagnosed with autism. Those diagnosed with highfunctioning autism (HFA), in particular, may be the fastest growing segment (Rao, Beidel, & Murray, 2008).Children with HFA lack critical social skills such as initiating and maintaining social interactions, sharingaffective experience or understanding the perspectives of others, cooperation and negotiation (Macintosh &Dissanayake, 2006).Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a promising platform for social skills learning. Via a 3D simulationof real-world experiences, VR based learning enables the practice of social interaction skills in a nonthreatening sandbox setting before testing them out in the real world (Schmidt & Schmidt, 2008). Supportingmultisensory interactions for multiple users across a distance is another promising feature of VR basedenvironments because the learning can be extended to multiple settings. Yet prior reviews of the educationalapplications of VR suggested that its affordance for learning still needs to be studied together with othermediating factors, such as instructional strategies and learner characteristics (Mikropoulos & Natsis, 2011).This mixed-method, multi-case study aims to examine the salient features of VR based learning tasksthat contribute to the social competencies development of children with high-functioning autism. Specifically,the research question to be addresses is: What VR-based learning tasks and scenarios would reinforce socialinteraction performance of children with high-functioning autism?Literature reviewTheory of executive dysfunction and weak central coherence in autismAn important theoretical account of autism is executive dysfunction (Denckla, 1996). Executive functioning(EF) is defined as the ability to initiate and maintain a set of problem-solving behaviors for attainment of afuture goal, such as planning, intentionality (e.g., ability to create and maintain goal-directed behaviors),cognitive flexibility (e.g., shifting attention between stimuli/response sets), and inhibition (of irrelevantresponses or impulse) (Ozonoff, Pennington, & Rogers, 1991). Adopting this theoretical perspective, a coreintervention design and research hypothesis in this study is that designing and arranging environmental stimuliand problem-based learning tasks that purposefully motivate, scaffold, and instill the practice of executivefunctioning should promote the social competencies development of learners with autism.Naturalistic interventions for children with autismAlthough there are some common diagnostic features, there is still great heterogeneity associated with autism.Hence it is critical yet challenging to design an intervention that will be effective and versatile for diverselearners with autism because their specific needs will vary. Recent reviews of social skill interventions withindividuals with autism proposed a reduction of direct intervention for naturalistic intervention, and thetransferring of control for prompting social interactions from teacher verbal antecedents to self-monitoring ornaturally occurring stimuli (e.g., Rao et al., 2008). A naturalistic intervention is usually conducted in looselycontrolled contexts and incorporates the target child’s preferences into the social skills training.ICLS 2018 Proceedings973© ISLSIn spite of their promise, naturalistic and adaptive interventions for children with high-functioningautism are still understudied but worthy candidates for further development and testing (Rao et al., 2008). Arecent review on the interventions of social skills learning (Authors, 2017) reported that prior research typicallylacks a purposeful investigation of instructional procedures and learning activities in the intervention, and it isdifficult to determine circumstances in which the intervention is impactful, or to extract findings that maycontribute to the design heuristics and theoretical insights that will guide future intervention development.Virtual reality for naturalistic social skills trainingResearch also showed that children with autism tend to enjoy computerized intervention programs and havemade significant learning gains using various technology-integrated training packages, such as cartoons, videomodeling, computer-assisted instruction, and computer games (Beaumont & Sofronoff, 2008). In comparisonwith other computerized programs, virtual reality supports high-fidelity role-playing to facilitate the transfer ofskills between taught and real contexts, and provides a multi-user, open-ended design space for real timecollaboration. VR has intrinsic appeal as an instructional tool for children with autism who are typically visuallearners (Mitchell et al., 2007). Yet empirical research examining the design and instructional characteristics ofa VR-based social skill training program is still limited. Previous VR-based social skill interventions weretypically multimedia direct instruction or highlighting a single social scenario (Laffey, Stichter, & Schmidt,2010; Mitchell et al., 2007). Extending prior research, we investigated the design and affordance of a variety ofVR-based social problem-solving scenarios and tasks, including agent-facilitated and peer-enacted role-playing,collaborative artifact design, and virtual gaming, in motivating and enhancing the social interaction performanceby children with autism.MethodsVR based social skill learning environmentUsing OpenSimulator, we constructed a 3D virtual world that simulated the residential community, a virtualschool, amusement parks, and various resorts. This virtual world supports social role-playing, collaborativedesign quests, and virtual gaming. Non-player characters were developed as interactive pedagogical agents thatprovided structured prompts based on the triggering events. Two virtual facilitators, incarnated into a variety ofsocial characters via a voice-morphing software, provided adaptive scaffolding. The prompts and scaffoldsfocused on activating and guiding learners’ involvement in executive functioning during the aforementionedlearning tasks. The intervention program was aimed to promote the performance of responding, initiating socialinteractions, interpersonal negotiation, cognitive flexibility (e.g., switching between solutions, multiple tasks, orperspectives), and positive self-identity manifestation.Participants and procedureA mixed-method multi-case study was conducted to examine the potential association between the virtualscenario and learning task design features and learners’ social interaction performance. Nine 10-14-year-oldchildren who had a formal medical or educational diagnosis of high functioning autism, including one girl andeight boys, participated in the VR-based learning program at home. Each child went through the program over16-31 intervention sessions (.75 to 1 hour per session), based on each child’s progress and availability.Participants’ social interaction performance was measured at 3-5 baseline sessions. When all baselinedata are stable by level, trend, and variability, the VR-based social skill intervention was introduced to child 1.The other participants remained in the baseline condition. When the measures of child 1 gained stability overconsecutive sessions during the intervention, child 2 began the intervention while other children continued inthe baseline condition. This process repeated for each child until the last one. The sequence of participation wasrandom and the frequency of participation was customized based on each participant’s progress and schedule.Data collection and analysisBehavioral data was collected from the participants via screen recording and onsite observation of theirparticipation actions and reactions. We then conducted behavioral analysis with the recorded social interactionperformance (215 .75-1hr sessions), using time sampling (per 30 seconds) as the primary unit of coding. Thecoding focused on the manifestation and frequency of positive and negative enactments of the targeted socialcompetencies. The coding followed a structured protocol proving the operational definition and examples ofeach performance measure, and was supported by an observational data gathering application that enables realtime collection and coding of data obtained from infield and video-based observational processes. Three trainedcoders independently coded a randomly-selected 20% of the recordings. The interrater reliability was .86. AfterICLS 2018 Proceedings974© ISLSmore formal discussion and reaching 100% agreement on the frequency and occurrence contexts for every coreperformance measure and their exemplified events, two trained coders then coded the remained recordings.Based on the social interaction behavioral coding results, we then calculated the average frequency ofsuccessful enactments of each targeted social interaction competency (i.e., average counts of successfulenactments of each competency in a selected 3-min interval) in each baseline and intervention session. The typeof learning task and simulated social problem scenario (setting) of each intervention session were also coded. Tobetter examine participants’ longitudinal social interaction performance during the progression of learning tasksand scenarios, we adopted the time series analysis approach (Jebb, Tay, Wang, & Huang, 2015) to integratetemporal dynamics in salient pattern detection. We calculated a seasonal index using the following formula foreach participant with each VR-based social learning task and setting in order to examine the associationbetween the type of VR-based learning tasks/scenarios and a participant’s social interaction performance.S-index =If a simulated social scenario (setting) or a learning task’s S-index is higher than 1, this specific setting or taskhas a privileged intervention effect in comparison with others, whereas a smaller-than-1 S-index represents anunderprivileged intervention effect. We also conducted a visual analysis of time series cross-participant graphs(i.e., graphing the data collected and visually inspecting the differences among simulated scenarios and taskswithin and across participants) to further examine whether there is a functional relation between the scenarioand learning task design features and the outcome variables.ResultsTable 1 provided a summary of average seasonal indices of VR-based learning tasks. Across participants, theactivity of virtual world exploration reinforces responding and interaction initiation more than higher-ordersocial skills of negotiation, positive self-identity expression, and cognitive flexibility. Among virtual gamingtasks, the chess game showed a differing intervention effect from virtual sports games on the performance ofthree higher-order social skills. In the social games that learners voluntarily initiated (e.g., racing game andscavenge hunting), the intervention effect was balanced for various social skills. VR-based digital story tellinghad two forms – creative storytelling using fantasy-themed 3D visuals versus social storytelling based onemulated historical characters. The former fostered self-identity while the latter better facilitated negotiation.Role-play tasks, whether agent-facilitated or peer-enacted, reinforced social interaction performanceconsistently. The task of acting as a waiter in a virtual amusement-park fish/chip shop, in particular, promotedthe performance of initiation as well as higher-order social skills. In comparison with creative building, clientsolicited artifact building had an underprivileged intervention effect on self-identity expression.Table 1: S-indices of intervention effects of VR-based learning tasksActivityRespondingInitiationNegotiationSelf-IdentityExplorationMath GameChess GameSports GamesRacing GameScavenge HuntingCreative storytellingSocial storytellingDietitian RoleplayLibrarian InterviewPark Worker RoleplayWaiter RoleplayClient-solicited BuildingCreative Building1.371.050.961.041.190.991.181.081.151.120.971.320.971.230.920.940.930.701.211.130.911.100.871.071.021.641.020.970.471.001.690.241.471.090.733.390.901.070.930.981.070.980.691.160.301.061.020.831.970.970.880.961.151.000.671.03CognitiveFlexibility0.751.092.120.670.490.980.901.191.150.991.081.041.060.98Table 2 summarized the average S-indices of simulated social scenarios/settings in the virtual world. Ingeneral, the scenarios where the participants got to roam the virtual land and approach objects freely (e.g., thesandbox, village, amusement park, a Lego kingdom, and an underwater resort) were underprivileged in fosteringthe performance of negotiation or cognitive flexibility. In comparison, in a scenario where participants’ agencywas lessened (e.g., school nurses office), the performance of negotiation and cognitive flexibility improvedwhereas that of initiation and self-identity expression decreased.ICLS 2018 Proceedings975© ISLSTable 2: S-indices of intervention effects of VR-based social scenarios/settingsScenario/SettingRespondingInitiationNegotiationSelf-identitySandbox (Open World)School ClassroomSchool CafeteriaSchool Nurses OfficeVillageAmusement ParkFish & Chip StoreLego KingdomWestern Town ResortUnderwater ResortSnow Resort1.140.970.950.941.281.041.541.070.960.871.010.810.910.830.470.930.921.650.811.040.941.010.810.890.901.330.400.341.050.581.100.621.140.690.790.850.600.861.040.811.050.840.831.42CognitiveFlexibility0.730.830.771.240.540.751.080.841.240.841.05The finding on the differential effects of the VR-based learning tasks and social scenarios on eachsocial competency suggested that participants with different social learning needs would benefit from themdifferently. This implication was validated by the visual analysis of time series cross-participant graphs.Conclusion and implicationsThe current study findings indicated that the designers of VR-based learning should dynamically adapt thedesign and presentation of VR-based learning tasks and simulation scenarios based on the targetedcompetencies and the in-situ reactions of learners. The study findings will enrich the research of inclusive andadaptive e-learning by illustrating the design of naturalistic, design- and play-mediated social skills training.The project will also offer theoretical and empirical guidance for the future design of a computer-assisted,versatile, and immersive learning experience for learners with special needs.ReferencesDenckla, M.
