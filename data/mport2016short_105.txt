Sixty-seven students were randomly assigned to receive the feedback thateither fit or did not fit their RF. Results revealed a significant interaction between an individual‚ÄôsRF and the type of feedback received after controlling for the student‚Äôs prior achievement. Inparticular, the students demonstrated better performance when receiving the fit feedback thanthe non-fit feedback. Further analysis of different performing groups showed that this identifiedinteraction was significant only for the middle performing students, but not for the lower orhigher performing groups. The findings suggested that the student‚Äôs RF may moderate theimpact of feedback on students‚Äô statistics performance, and this moderation pans out differentlydepending on the student‚Äôs previous achievement.IntroductionFeedback is often considered as an essential component in learning and teaching. Extant literature indicates thatto become effective, feedback must be adaptive (Nicol, 2010) and be addressed in the context in which learningoccurs (Hattie & Timperly, 2007); otherwise, feedback would produce inconsistent effects on learning outcomesdue to the variations in student characteristics (e.g., Malachowski, Martin, & Vallade, 2013).Unfortunately, many undergraduate classes afford limited opportunities for the instructors to provideadaptive feedback for each student (Voelke, 2013). The content of the feedback is often neither sufficient (Jacobs& Chase, 1992) nor adaptive (Nicol, 2010) to have desirable effects on learners. Moreover, very little effort hasbeen made to examine the effectiveness of feedback (Price, Handley, Millar, & O‚ÄôDonovan, 2010).This study attempts to address these challenges by implementing a differentiated feedback strategy in anintroductory statistics class in light of the regulatory focus (RF) theory (Higgins, 1997). In particular, we designeddifferentiated feedback to become aligned with the student‚Äôs achievement levels and framed the feedback so thatit would either fit or not fit the learners‚Äô RF. The major goal of this study is to determine to what extent the fitbetween the individual‚Äôs RF and the type of feedback would affect students‚Äô course performance. We were alsointerested in whether such effect would differ for students with different previous achievement in statistics.Regulatory focusAccording to regulatory focus (RF) theory (Higgins, 1997), there are two distinct systems of self-regulation‚Äîi.e.,promotion and prevention‚Äîwhich regulate goal-directed behaviors. The promotion system is mainly concernedwith aspirations, accomplishments and advancement. Individuals with a promotion focus are inclined to focus on‚Äúthe pleasurable presence of positive outcomes (Higgins et al., 2001, p. 4)‚Äù, and therefore, use promotionstrategies, such as risk taking and eager advancement, to achieve ideal goals. In contrast, the prevention system isprimarily concerned with duties, obligations, and responsibilities. Individuals with a prevention focus tend to beprudent and precautionary to avoid negative outcomes (Crowe & Higgins, 1997).Regulatory focus influences the motivational effects of feedback via regulatory fit (Higgins, 2000). Whenthere is compatibility between an individual‚Äôs goals and the types of feedback provided, regulatory fit occurs, andthat leads to an increase in motivation and performance (Higgons, 1997). Past studies have examined regulatoryfit in various fields (e.g., Florack & Scarbis, 2006) and in higher education (e.g., Shu & Lam, 2011). These studiesindicate that a message can motivate people more effectively in fit conditions compared to non-fit conditions.MethodsParticipants and contextThe study was conducted in a three-credit undergraduate course, Elementary Statistics, offered to the wholecampus by the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at a state university in a Midwestern state in the US.Due to its large enrollment, the class was divided into 13 sections, with approximately 30 students each. SixICLS 2016 Proceedings795¬© ISLSinstructors were assigned to teach this course, with each teaching up to three sections. Since this study was a pilotproject instead of a full-scale implementation, students from three sections (n = 90) taught by the same instructorparticipated in this study.Design and proceduresIn the first week of the semester, we invited the 90 students to complete a Regulatory Focus Questionnaire (RFQ;Higgins et al, 2001) and received 67 complete responses with a completion rate of 74.4%. Based on the responses,46 students were identified as having a promotion focus, the other 21 students a prevention focus.We randomly assigned the students with a promotion focus to receive either promotion or preventionfeedback and repeated the same procedure to the students with a prevention focus (see Table 1). Taken together,35 students received the ‚Äúfit‚Äù feedback and 32 students received the ‚Äúnon-fit‚Äù feedback in this study.Table 1: Students receiving promotion or prevention feedback through random assignment.Receiving Promotion FeedbackReceiving Prevention FeedbackTotalStudents with Promotion Focus24 (fit)22 (non-fit)46Students with Prevention Focus10 (non-fit)11 (fit)21Total343367Over the study, five quizzes were administered approximately every three weeks to evaluate student performance.The students took their first and second quizzes in the third and sixth weeks of the semester. The average scoreson these quizzes were considered as the baseline data for student achievement prior to the intervention. After thesecond quiz, the students started to receive performance feedback about one week after each quiz. They wouldalso receive a quiz reminder about a week before each quiz. Both the performance feedback and the reminderwere differentiated to match either the promotion focus or the prevention focus. Moreover, the performancefeedback was differentiated to align with the students‚Äô quiz performance levels.MeasuresRegulatory focusTo assess the students‚Äô RF, we used the Regulatory Focus Questionnaire (RFQ), which was composed of elevenLikert items asking the respondents‚Äô preference for promotion or prevention tasks (see Higgins et al, 2001).Prior achievementStudents‚Äô prior achievement was determined by the average scores of Quiz 1 and Quiz 2.Statistics performanceStatistics performance, evaluated based on the average scores of Quiz 4 and Quiz 5, was treated as the dependentvariable in this study. Quiz 3 was excluded from statistics performance because its format was different fromother quizzes.FindingsBaseline performanceAn independent-sample t test suggested no significant difference in prior achievement between students assignedto the fit condition and those in the non-fit condition (Mfit = 69.94, Mnon-fit = 68.41, t(65) = .37, p = .72).Overall effect of differentiated feedback on statistics performanceAn analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted to determine the effects of the feedback on students‚Äôachievement. The dependent variable was the students‚Äô statistics performance. The independent variables werethe students‚Äô RF and the type of feedback. The covariate was their prior achievement. The Levene‚Äôs test was nonsignificant (p = .10), suggesting the assumption of homogeneity of variances was not violated. The results showeda significant interaction between the individual‚Äôs RF and the feedback type (F(1, 62) = 5.09, p < .05, ùúÇùúÇùëùùëù2 = .08),suggesting that matching the feedback to the individual‚Äôs RF might significantly affect student learning (see Table2). Subsequent analysis revealed that the fit group had higher statistics performance (M = 61.80, SD = 23.81) thanthe non-fit group (M = 53.98, SD = 34.35), although the difference was not significant (t(54.60) = 1.07, p = .29).ICLS 2016 Proceedings796¬© ISLSAnalysis of students from different achievement groupsStudents were divided into higher (n = 23), middle (n = 23), and lower (n = 21) performing groups based on theirprior achievement in statistics. An ANCOVA was conducted within each group. The results of the Levene‚Äôs testswere non-significant for all the three groups (all p‚Äôs > .10). Results are presented in Table 2.Table 2: ANCOVA results for the whole sample and the subgroups.Whole samplen67Higher performing23Middle performing23Lower performing21df111111111111RFFeedbackRF * FeedbackRFFeedbackRF * FeedbackRFFeedbackRF * FeedbackRFFeedbackRF * FeedbackNote: *p < .05. **p < .01.F8.69110.1665.091.0501.156.3053.5929.7987.8704.8022.0042.055p.005**.002**.028*.825.297.587.074.006**.012*.044*.176.171ùúºùúºùüêùüêùíëùíë.123.141.076.017.003.017.166.352.304.231.111.114For the higher performing group, neither the feedback nor the students‚Äô RF was found to have a significant impacton the students‚Äô statistics performances. The interaction between the two variables was not significant, either (allp‚Äôs > .10). As Figure 1 shows, the students from the fit group had slightly lower scores than those in the non-fitgroup on every quiz of the semester, which seemed to be inconsistent with what the RF theory predicts.10080604020088.6486.67Quiz 187.0785.93Quiz 255.5650.83Quiz 389.1981.76Quiz 473.6469.03FitNon-fitQuiz 5Figure 1. Average Score Comparison for Higher Performing Group.For the lower performing group, the individual‚Äôs RF was found to be significantly associated with the student‚Äôsstatistics performance. But neither the feedback nor its interaction with the RF was significant (all p‚Äôs > .05). Thestudents from the fit group had lower performance on Quiz 1 than the non-fit group, but they consistently achievedhigher scores on the subsequent quizzes than their counterparts from the non-fit group (See Figure 2). Notably,the achievement gap between the fit and non-fit groups was larger on Quiz 4 and Quiz 5 than the first threequizzes. So, there might be subtle effects of the differentiated feedback (F(1, 16) = 2.055, p = .171, ùúÇùúÇùëùùëù2 = .114)that are worth investigating in the future.80604058.5055.7039.7720046.28Quiz 1Quiz 264.7540.7238.98Quiz 353.91Quiz 440.7831.58FitNon-fitQuiz 5Figure 2.

On the first three quizzes, the students from the fit group had comparable average scores withthe non-fit group, but they outperformed their counterparts on Quiz 4 and Quiz 5, as shown in Figure 3. Furtheranalysis indicated that the students who received the fit feedback had higher performances than those who receivedthe non-fit feedback, although the difference was not significant (p > .05).806074.1170.854066.667.9967.5440.0637.3541.85200Quiz 1Quiz 2Quiz 3Quiz 444.8729.01FitNon-fitQuiz 5Figure 3.

Resultssuggested that the alignment between the students‚Äô RF and the type of feedback could significantly affect learners‚Äôachievement. The findings further suggested that the learners‚Äô prior achievement could play a role in theirresponses to the feedback. In the middle- and lower-performing groups, the students receiving the fit feedbackdemonstrated better course performance than those receiving the non-fit feedback, but the pattern was notobserved with the higher-performing group. When designing feedback, it is important to consider both thelearners‚Äô RF and their prior achievement in order to improve their performance. It also seems necessary to explorebetter strategies to motivate the higher-performing students.ReferencesCrowe, E., & Higgins, E. T. (1997).
