The results with 90 high school participants found that students who weremembers of experienced groups outperformed, invested less mental effort, and were morecognitively efficient than students in non-experienced groups in both tests. These results haveimportant instructional implications for designing collaborative environments and providesupport for the advantages of forming teams with relevant collaborative experiences beforestarting collaborative learning.Keywords: collaborative learning, cognitive load theory, prior collaborative experience.IntroductionCollaborative learning is an extensively used instructional technique in educational settings. It is the process bywhich individuals interdependently interact in small groups to learn from solving academic problems (Gillies,2016; Slavin, 2014). This instructional approach has been broadly studied from multiple disciplines andperspectives (Hmelo-Silver, Chinn, Chan, & O'Donnell, 2013; Hmelo-Silver & Chinn, 2015). Although there isresearch from different perspectives using different theories, the conditions under which collaborative learning iseffective and efficient are still insufficiently understood (Kester & Paas, 2005; Kirschner, Paas, & Kirschner,2009). Studying collaborative learning from a cognitive perspective (i.e., taking human cognitive architecture intoaccount) will provide valuable insights and guidelines for designing effective and efficient collaborative learningenvironments. The current study shows that in this context, having prior collaborative learning experience is animportant determining factor.Collaboration experienceResearchers have been concerned about the conditions under which collaborative groups are most effective. Theliterature presents multiple ways of designing learning environments based on collaboration (Gillies, 2016; Slavin,2012). However, the availability of task-group skills has proven to be a critical factor in achieving better learningoutcomes. (Delise, Allen Gorman, Brooks, Rentsch, & Steele-Johnson, 2010; Fuchs, Fuchs, Kazdan, & Allen,1999; Johnson & Johnson, 2009; Webb, 2009).Literature shows that experience with collaboration produces positive effects on performance with onlya few instructional sessions and with benefits extending up to one year. Prichard, Stratford, and Bizo (2006), forexample, trained groups in two 45-minute sessions delivered one week apart. They found that the groups thatreceived this treatment and remained intact performed better than groups composed of reassigned members anduntrained groups. They also found that groups with reassigned members outperformed untrained groups. Buchs,Gilles, Antonietti, and Butera (2015) gave a 10-minute instruction to groups on cooperative skills. They foundthat collaborative learning in dyads that received the instruction led to better learning outcomes compared tolearning individually or collaboratively without the instruction.As to long-term benefits, Prichard, Bizo, and Stratford (2006) tested whether the benefits of collaborationexperience were maintained for two semesters. They compared three cohorts. In cohort 1, learners worked ingroups during Semester 1 without training and in Semester 2 were reassigned to new groups. In cohort 2, groupsreceived instruction on how to work collaboratively in Semester 1 and in Semester 2 group members werereassigned to new groups. Cohort 3 received guidance and their groups remained intact during both semesters.The results showed that the groups that were instructed on how to work collaboratively outperformed untrainedgroups. However, the guidance advantage of cohort 2 decreased significantly in Semester 2 while cohort 3maintained its performance in both semesters. The researchers concluded that the benefits of knowing how tocollaborate may be lost if groups are disbanded.ICLS 2018 Proceedings112© ISLSThese and other research (Franke et al., 2015; Jordan & Métais, 1997; Yamarik, 2007) suggest that it ispossible to instruct learners as to how to effectively collaborate in groups and thereby obtain immediate positiveresults compared to groups without this instruction. To understand the positive effects of prior collaborativelearning experience one can look at the results from a cognitive perspective, namely, that collaborative skills maybe a type of knowledge that can be acquired in long-term memory (LTM) and transferred to analogous domainspecific tasks (Kalyuga, 2009).Collaborative learning from a cognitive load perspectiveCognitive load theory (CLT) looks at how people learn considering their cognitive architecture (Sweller, Ayres,& Kalyuga, 2011). CLT is based on the premise that learning is limited by the spatiotemporal limitations ofworking memory (WM), namely that its capacity is very limited and that processing must occur within a veryshort period of time (Baddeley, 2011). A crucial factor here is the number of novel interactive elements of a taskor learning material. If new information surpasses the WM capacity (overload), learning is poor. For this reason,the cognitive load of complex tasks (i.e., tasks with a large number of interacting elements) must be optimizedthrough instructional manipulation. One way to reduce the cognitive load and promote better learning of complextasks is to design appropriate collaborative environments taking advantage the primary knowledge associated withgroup communication (Paas & Sweller, 2012). Instead of processing all new information elements, eachcollaborator would receive a small, relevant information quantity to process and share with others. The collectivedistribution of information not only reduces the cognitive load of the task but also takes advantage of thebiologically social way of learning (Paas & Sweller, 2012; Tomasello & Gonzalez-Cabrera, 2017).Studying collaborative learning from a cognitive load perspective is gaining attention (F. Kirschner,Paas, & Kirschner, 2011; Paas & Sweller, 2012). An effect explaining the advantage of collaborative learning isthe collective WM effect which holds that in collaborative learning, group members can make use of each other’sWM resources by sharing the cognitive load imposed by a complex task (F. Kirschner et al., 2011). Becausecollaborative learning requires investing additional WM resources in transactional activities, (i.e., communicationand coordination), the benefit of sharing information processing among collaborators should be larger than theload related to the transactional activities (F. Kirschner et al., 2011; F. Kirschner, Paas, Kirschner, & Janssen,2011). Studies on the effect of (a) task complexity (i.e., low versus high complexity; (F. Kirschner et al., 2011;Kirschner, Paas, Kirschner, et al., 2011), (b) prior knowledge (i.e., novice versus knowledgeable learners; (Zhang,Kalyuga, Lee, & Lei, 2016; Zhang, Kalyuga, Lee, Lei, & Jiao, 2015), and (c) instructional strategies such asworked-out examples (WOEs) and the solution of conventional or partially structured problems (Retnowati,Ayres, & Sweller, 2010, 2016; Zhang, Ayres, & Chan, 2011) have generally found that collaborative learningproduces better learning when task complexity is high, groups are composed of novices and advanced learners(i.e., heterogeneous groups), and problems are partially structured.Until now, however, the possible advantage of having prior collaborative experience on relevant taskshas not been studied from a CLT perspective. Prior experience working together may have group members gainspecific generalized knowledge related to collaborative skills. With respect to CLT, this means that experiencedgroups have appropriate collective knowledge structures in LTM (i.e., group schemata) that reduce the load whenlearning from comparable (i.e., the same or related domain) new complex tasks. These schemata would functionas an group central executive that guide groups to better regulate themselves (Järvelä, Järvenoja, Malmberg, &Hadwin, 2013; Kalyuga, 2015), get involved in joint cognitive activities related to the learning tasks (Webb,2009), and avoid cognitive and emotional non-relevant interactions. When necessary, this collective knowledgecan be recovered from LTM by activating retrieval cues that facilitate analogical transfer (Gick & Holyoak, 1983;Kalyuga, 2013). If collaborative learning tasks are highly demanding, relevant prior collaborative experiencecould, therefore, facilitate acquiring content knowledge (i.e., the subject matter of the learning task) becausecollaborators can focus their collective WM resources on relevant task-related transactional activities. In sum,groups with relevant previous collaborative experience would learn better and be more cognitively efficient thangroups that have not had appropriate experience or received guidance on how to collaborate.The present studyThis study looks at whether prior collaborative experience in relevant tasks improves the effectiveness andefficiency of the process and outcomes of collaborative learning in complex analog tasks. We expected thatexperienced groups would perform better (H1), invest less mental effort (H2), and be more cognitively efficient(H3) than non-experienced groups.MethodsICLS 2018 Proceedings113© ISLSParticipantsThe study was conducted with 90 Ecuadorian 10th students grade from a private high school (see Table 1; 46males (51.1%); 44 females (48.9%), M age = 13.86 years 13.86 years (SD = .71). The choice for this sample isbased upon the fact that collaborative learning in Ecuador is often introduced at this level as an approach to studyand learning. To control the effect of task prior knowledge (Kalyuga, Ayres, Chandler, & Sweller, 2003),participants received a knowledge test before the learning tasks that resulted in the exclusion of three learnersfrom the learning phase and the following ones. Participants were notified of the study, gave informed consent,were informed that they would not receive academic compensation for participation, and were randomly assignedto the two learning conditions.Table 1: Participants for each study phaseLearning ConditionsTraining PhaseExperienced GroupsNon-Experienced GroupsLearning PhaseExperienced GroupsNon-Experienced GroupsRetention Test PhaseExperienced GroupsNon-Experienced GroupsDelayed Test PhaseExperienced GroupsNon-Experienced GroupsN904545874542864442854540Design and procedureA one-way (experienced vs. non-experienced group) factorial design was used. The study was conducted in fourphases with 45-minute sessions: training, learning, retention test, and delayed test. Two instructors and theexperimenter guided participants by reading guidelines aloud before each phase. Instructors were informed inadvance about the procedure and were supervised by the experimenter to ensure the fidelity. A computer with adigital clock was present to show the number of minutes allotted to each task.Training phaseIn this phase, groups were formed and instructed on how to effectively collaborate on a domain-specific task inmathematics (see Materials). It began in the second week of the new school term after the school vacation,ensuring that participants had no prior collaboration experience in the previous two months. The 90 participantswere randomly assigned to two conditions: 45 worked in 3-person groups (i.e., experienced group condition) and45 worked individually. All participants worked on the same training tasks during four sessions, two sessions perday, over one week. The first tasks had no time constraints. The last two tasks of the second session onward hadto be solved in 10 min. While resolving the tasks, learners from the experienced group condition were instructedon how to interact and coordinate amongst themselves to share their items and maintain in their WM the partialcalculations to find the correct solution. Learners in the individual condition worked on the tasks by themselves.At the end of each session, participants received the correct answers and were asked to plan (5 min) how theymight work better.Learning phaseThis phase evaluated the effect of team formation on the learning process. It was conducted in one session (45min) after the training phase. Participants received a prior knowledge pre-test consisting of three items relating toeconomics (see Materials): total fixed cost, unit variable cost, and price (see Table 2). They were asked toindividually calculate the break-even point. Then, students that worked individually were randomly distributedinto 14 3-persons groups (i.e., the non-experienced group condition). The experienced groups remained intact. Allgroups worked on three tasks for 21 min (i.e., 7 min per task). Groups were told by instructors to focus on thetopic – to avoid extraneous conversations – and writing while performing the calculation was not permitted – toavoid cognitive off-loading through external representations (Van Bruggen, Kirschner, & Jochems, 2002). Theinstructors allowed only one group member to write down the answer for each problem and all groups membersto write down the amount of mental effort invested in each problem. If a group solved the problem before theICLS 2018 Proceedings114© ISLSallotted time, they could check again if the problem was well resolved and/or had to wait before beginning on thenext problem.Retention and delayed test phasesThese final two phases evaluated the effectiveness and efficiency of collaborative learning outcomes. They wereconducted one and seven days after the learning phase, respectively. Participants were required to individuallysolve three problems in 30 min (i.e., 10 min per problem). Participants recorded the amount of mental effortinvested in each problem (see Measurements). For these phases, writing down calculations was permitted.MaterialsMaterials used were in the domain of mathematics and the analogous domain of economics. Solving quadraticequations by factoring were utilized in the group training phase and break-even point calculation problems ineconomics in the learning, retention test, and delayed test phases. All materials were paper-based.Training phaseIn Session 1, participants received a two-part booklet. The first part gave a general introduction to quadraticequations with two WOEs using the factoring method; “a step-by-step demonstration of how to perform a task orhow to solve a problem” (Clark, Nguyen, & Sweller, 2006, p. 190). The second part presented the generalizeddomain group knowledge via rules on how to collaboratively solve the equations, followed by a WOEdemonstrating how each member should apply them, and a conventional task with the correct answer. Allparticipants received the same instruction. In Session 2, participants again received the collaborative learningrules, two conventional problems with the correct answer and a conventional problem without the correct answer.In Sessions 3 and 4, groups and individuals received three conventional quadratic equation problems without acorrect answer. Each group member received 1/3 of the information elements, which means that they wererelevant, but insufficient to solve the problem.Learning phaseCalculating a break-even point in economics is a task which is analogous to solving quadratic equations becausethey display similar characteristics such as combining multiple numerical values, calculating partial step answers,holding them in WM, finding a unique correct answer, and so forth. Participants received a booklet introducingrelevant concepts with two WOEs, prompt questions, three learning tasks, and a piece of paper with examples ofcosts and the break-even point in unit’s formula. A WOE showed how to calculate the break-even point in unitsand sales with a profit margin. The other was similar but without the profit margin. The WOEs had a 7-stepprocedure (see Table 2). Some of the prompt questions were: a) What were the break-even points? b) What werethe seven steps to calculate the break-even points? c) What was the difference between the break-even points inunits and sales? d) How did you calculate the contribution? and so forth.Table 2: Steps to calculate the break-even pointSteps to solve the problemExample of calculations1.

Furthermore, theSweller and Chandler method (1994) was used to determine the task complexity, consisting of counting thenumber of interacting elements to solve the tasks. As shown in Table 2, the procedure had seven steps and nineitems. The items represented the values to calculate the break-even point (i.e., three fixed costs, three variablecosts, a price, a profit margin, and the number of produced things). This amounted to a total of 45 (includingmathematical signs). For each step, a partial result had to be calculated and had to be held in WM (Column 4) andthen integrated with another partial result. Finally, not allowing students to write down the calculations but havingthem keep the information in WM increased the task complexity. Based upon these analyses, it can be claimedthat the tasks were complex.Retention and the delayed test phasesSix complex problems similar to the learning tasks were designed, but cost names were varied for new businesssituations. These tasks had an equal level of complexity (i.e., number of information elements) to the learningtasks. Participants received worksheets with three tasks on the day after the learning tasks (i.e., retention test), andthe other three seven days after the learning tasks (i.e., delayed test). Each problem included a table with sevennumbered rows to write down the calculations for each step of the task’s solution.MeasurementPerformancePerformance was measured in the learning, retention test, and delayed test phases. The maximum score for all thethree learning tasks was 3; 1 per task, if correct and 0 if incorrect. For each of the three retention test tasks (i.e.,retention test phase), 7 points could be awarded. These points were based on the 7 calculations required todetermine the break-even point. A correct step's calculation received 1 point and an incorrect 0. This resulted in amaximum score of 21 points and a minimum of 0. If a step was partially correct (e.g., if only two of the threevariable variables were recognized in step 2), a proportional score was given. The same scores system was appliedto the delayed test phase. All scores were transformed into proportions.Cognitive loadCognitive load was measured after each task of the learning, retention and delayed test phases with the subjective9-point mental effort rating scale (Paas, 1992). Participants were asked to rate how much effort it took for themto solve the problems on a scale ranging from very, very low effort (1) to very, very high effort (9). This scale hasbeen found to be sensitive to changes in task complexity, to be non-intrusive, valid, and reliable (Van Gog &Paas, 2008).Cognitive efficiencyCognitive efficiency was calculated by standardizing each of the participant’s scores for task performance and themental effort (Paas & Van Merriënboer, 1993). For each participant, z-scores were calculated for effort (R) andperformance (P) to obtain the cognitive efficiency (E) using the formula: E = [(P – R)/21/2]. A high efficiencydenotes relatively high performance combined with relatively low mental effort. By contrast, low efficiencydenotes relatively low performance combined with relatively high mental effort.ResultsData were analyzed with a one-way (experienced vs. non-experienced groups) analyses of variance (ANOVAs).Dependent variables were performance, mental effort, and efficiency, which were measured for the learning,retention, and delayed phases (see Table 3 for descriptive statistics). A significance level of .05 and casewisedeletion were used to analyze data. Partial eta-squared was computed as a measurement of the effect size, withvalues of .01, .06 and .14, corresponding respectively to small, medium and large effects (Cohen, 1988).Learning phaseConcerning performance, ANOVA revealed no significant difference between experienced and non-experiencedgroups, F(1, 85) = .024, MSE = .742, ns. For mental effort, ANOVA revealed no significant difference betweenexperienced and non-experienced groups, F(1, 85) = .796, MSE = 1.709, ns. For cognitive efficiency, ANOVAalso revealed no significant difference between experienced and non-experienced groups, F(1, 85) = .367,MSE = 1.265, ns.ICLS 2018 Proceedings116© ISLSTable 3.

For mental effort, ANOVA showed a significantdifference between experienced and non-experienced groups, F(1, 83) = 4.095, MSE = 2.330, p = .046,η p 2 = .047. For cognitive efficiency, similarly ANOVA found a significant difference between experienced andnon-experienced groups, F(1, 83) = 6.176, MSE = 1.297, p = .015, η p 2 = .069.DiscussionThis study focused on the learning effectiveness and efficiency of groups with prior collaborative experience. Weexpected that experienced groups would perform better (H1), invest less mental effort (H2), and be morecognitively efficient (H3) than non-experienced groups. The results confirm the three hypotheses for retentionand delayed retention phases. Our data suggest that groups that received guidance and therefore had knowledgeschemata about how to work together on analogous tasks took advantage of their inter-individual activities tolearn better. The cognitive load associated with transactional activities (F. Kirschner et al., 2011) can besubstantially reduced through the use of such group schemata so that collective WM resources can be focused onproductive collective activities to construct better LTM mental representations on the content matter.The superior effectiveness and efficiency of the experienced groups confirm evidence of the effects oftraining obtained by Prichard, Stratford, et al. (2006) and Buchs et al. (2015). In addition, this research contributesto the emerging concept of generalizable domain knowledge of CLT at group level (Kalyuga, 2009, 2013, 2015).We suggest that collaborative experience in tasks relevant for later learning is a type of generalizable knowledgethat can be transferred to relatively new (i.e., analogous) learning situations. We can suggest that these task-basedcollaborative knowledge structures function as shared regulatory guides (Järvelä, Järvenoja, & Näykki, 2013;Kalyuga, 2015) that orient the interaction amongst collaborators. Consequently, experienced groups are more ableto reduce WM resources associated with unprofitable interactions and putting more cognitive effort on learningfrom each other while solving the problem (i.e., germane or productive interactions).This study has important instructional implications. If a task is complex, teachers should form groupscomposed of members who have previously worked together on similar tasks. Or, if this is not possible, implementa training phase like the one used in this study so that group skills can be acquired in a relatively short time.Important aspects of the preparation are: give specific instruction on how to work together using WOEs, provideincomplete and conventional tasks to apply and test collaborative schemata, use collaborative tasks in a relatedfield, and encourage group members to focus their interactions on the most demanding parts of the task. Once thecollaborative skills based on specific tasks have been acquired, groups can then be confronted with new complextasks in the same or related domain.Finally, more research is needed to overcome some limitations of this study. Because no evidence wasfound for our hypotheses in the collaborative learning phase, it is crucial to better understand the collaborativelearning process itself from a CLT perspective. Doing this requires an in-depth analysis of which are those groupICLS 2018 Proceedings117© ISLScognitive activities associated with information processing, and how learners support each other to manage taskrelated difficulties.All in all, CLT adds a dimension to our understanding of how to improve the effectiveness and efficiencyof collaborative learning.ReferencesBaddeley, A.
